      "content": "The US on Wednesday welcomed a meeting between Turkish and Armenian special representatives at their long-closed border, calling the normalization talks a \"positive step in bringing peace and stability to the South Caucasus.”\n\n\"We welcome this meeting. The United States would consider Türkiye-Armenia normalization a positive step in bringing peace and stability to the South Caucasus,\" a State Department spokesperson told Anadolu.\n\n\"Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to make significant progress toward finalizing a peace agreement, and we are committed to supporting that process. The time for peace is now,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nSpecial representatives from Türkiye and Armenia -- Turkish Ambassador Serdar Kilic and Armenian parliament Deputy Speaker Ruben Rubinyan -- met Tuesday at their countries' shared border for the fifth round of talks to normalize their long-strained relations.\n\nThe two sides \"reemphasized their agreement to continue the normalization process without any preconditions towards achieving the ultimate goal of full normalization between their respective countries,” the Armenian and Turkish foreign ministries said in identical statements.\n\nThey also agreed to \"assess the technical requirements to enable the functioning of the Akhurik/Akyaka railroad border gate in line with regional developments as well as to simplify their mutual visa procedures for diplomatic/official passport holders,” the statement said.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Türkiye was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia’s independence on Sept. 21, 1991.\n\nBut following the 1993 occupation by Armenian forces of the Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory, Türkiye closed its border with Armenia and severed diplomatic and commercial relations. There are other contentious issues, including the events of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOn Oct. 10, 2009, the two countries signed a peace accord, known as the Zurich Protocols, to establish diplomatic relations and open the border but failed to ratify the agreement in their respective national parliaments.\n\nFast forward to the fall of 2020 and the end of the 44-day second Karabakh war, which helped Azerbaijan recapture its territory and put Turkish-Armenian relations in a new phase.\n\nKilic and Rubinyan first met on Jan. 14 in Moscow and the second meeting was held in Vienna on Feb. 24.",

      "content": "Members of the Turkish community in Washington, D.C. staged a counter-protest Wednesday against Armenian demonstrators who gathered on the anniversary of the 1915 events.\n\nThe Armenian protestors marched in front of the Turkish Embassy and the residence of the Turkish ambassador as well as the Azerbaijani Embassy carrying banners and chanting slogans against Türkiye and Azerbaijan in support of Armenian claims.\n\nJoined by Azerbaijani and Ahiska Turks, the Turkish community members carried Turkish and Azerbaijani flags and protested against the Armenian group.\n\nOrganized by the Turkish-American National Steering Committee (TASC), the event began with the reciting of the national anthem and continued with chanting.\n\nSome banners said \"We Remember 58 Turkish Diplomats And Family Killed by ASALA/JCAG Terrorists,\" \"Let History Decide,\" and \"US Supreme Court Rejects Armenian Allegations.”\n\nIn 2021, US President Joe Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking with the long-held tradition of US presidents of refraining from using the term. The move was strongly rejected by Türkiye as \"null and void.”\n\nNearly 80 people -- 58 of them Turkish citizens, including 31 diplomats and members of their families -- were killed in attacks from 1973 to 1986 carried out by the ASALA and ARA terrorist groups.\n\nThe deadly campaign began in 1973 with the assassination of Türkiye’s Consul General in Los Angeles Mehmet Baydar and diplomat Bahadir Demir by a terrorist named Gourgen Yanikian.\n\n'Genocide is fabrication'\n\nTASC co-chair Melih Bektas told Anadolu that for the last five years, every April 24, the Turkish community has been responding to the Armenian \"lies and slanders\" together with the Turkish American community and citizens from the Turkic republics.\n\n\"What we particularly emphasize in the banners we prepared today is that this is a political issue. Both the US Supreme Court and the UN declare that these allegations are not true and that this is not a genocide,\" Bektas added.\n\nHe drew attention to the \"hateful looks and curses\" of 12 and 13-year-old Armenian children passing in front of Turkish people.\n\n“One of the points I would like to draw attention to is that while the hateful looks and curses of 12 and 13-year-old Armenian children passing in front of us reveal how pure and well-intentioned we are, we have seen how full of hate they are towards us,” Bektas said, stressing that the Turkish American community needs to be \"more conscious\" and resist this.\n\nAttending the demonstration, Azerbaijani citizen Vusal Aliev told Anadolu that they gathered in front of the residence to support their Turkish brothers and sisters.\n\n\"Because we are one nation, two states. This genocide is a fabrication,\" Aliev said.\n\nHe said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously suggested to open these archives and see if there was a genocide or not.\n\n\"They use this against Türkiye in politics. There is no such thing. If there were, they would come, and archives would be opened, everything would be revealed,\" Aliev added.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected the \"one-sided statements about the events of 1915 that have been made to satisfy certain radical circles.\"\n\n\"These statements, which distort the historical facts, are also contrary to international law. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has clearly underlined that the events of 1915 are a legitimate subject of debate,\" the ministry said.\n\nStressing that \"these biased and partial statements\" about history undermine the reconciliation efforts between the two communities, the ministry added that they encourage radical groups to commit hate crimes.\n\nTürkiye's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with the invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

      "content": "The author is the head of the foreign policy analysis department at the Baku, Azerbaijan-based Center of Analysis of International Relations.\n\nThe revision of the Armenian Constitution has been a topic of debate as the normalization process between Armenia, Azerbaijan and Türkiye progresses.\n\nThat is because the Armenian Constitution's spirit and philosophy are based on a declaration of independence that recognizes the regions of Azerbaijan and Türkiye as Armenian.\n\nArmenian officials have demonstrated, via their actions over the last 30 years, that it is more than simply a text; it is also part of Armenia's official policy. While occupying Azerbaijan's territory, Armenia left the annexation of Eastern Anatolia, which is Western Armenia, according to Armenian claims, to future generations, according to a remark made by former Armenian President Serzh Sarkisyan in 2011 in front of young activists.\n\nAs a result, for the true normalization process that began between Azerbaijan-Armenia and Türkiye-Armenia after the Second Karabakh War to be effective and to avoid any negative consequences in the future, the Armenian Constitution must be revised.\n\nThe only solution: Rewriting the constitution\n\nFollowing the Second Karabakh War, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev raised the issue for the first time in September 2021, stating that Armenia's Constitution should be revised to achieve true peace. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has lately expressed similar sentiments, claiming that the constitution should be rewritten rather than revised.\n\nTo do this, the constitution will be changed by a referendum. Following Pashinyan's comments, Aliyev reiterated the need for changes to the Armenian Constitution to sign a peace agreement.\n\nThe Armenian Declaration of Independence of Aug. 23, 1990, contains territorial claims against Türkiye and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe statement includes the following territorial claims regarding Azerbaijan: \"Based on the December 1, 1989, joint resolution of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) Supreme Council and the Karabakh National Council on the \"Reunification of the Armenian SSR and the Mountainous Region of Karabakh.\"\n\nIn Article 11 of the statement, Turkish territory is referred to as Western Armenia and allegations against Türkiye are expressed as follows: \"The Republic of Armenia stands in support of the task of achieving international recognition of the 1915 Genocide in Ottoman Türkiye and Western Armenia.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Western Armenia\" here refers to the eastern provinces of Türkiye. At the time of the declaration's adoption, Armenian nationalists, including Dashnaks, had significant power in Armenia, thanks to the efforts of the Karabakh committee, which was formed Feb. 13, 1988, and included Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia's first president.\n\nAlso, according to the preamble of the Armenian Constitution issued in 1995, the Armenian People acknowledge the basic foundations of Armenian statehood and pan-national aspirations embodied in Armenia's Declaration of Independence.\n\nIn summary, its constitution endorsed territorial claims against Azerbaijan and Türkiye.\n\nAll other laws governing the country's internal and international policies were written and developed in accordance with the constitution.\n\nMount Agri, situated within Türkiye's borders, was placed in the Armenian state flag as Ararat, symbolizing the reunification with Western Armenia. As a result, the protocol on normalization and development of diplomatic relations agreed between Türkiye and Armenia in 2010 could not be implemented. Because, under Armenian law, such foreign agreements must be ratified by the constitutional court before they can come into force.\n\nThe constitutional court authorized the protocols but noted that they could not violate the Declaration of Independence or the constitution.\n\nSubsequently, the constitutional court found that the protocols signed with Türkiye acknowledging Türkiye's geographical integrity could not be in conflict with the Declaration of Independence, therefore maintaining a territorial claim against Türkiye.\n\nThe same circumstance may apply to the peace deal negotiated with Azerbaijan, in which case the peace agreement signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan will not result in permanent normalization and peace.\n\nIn particular, Azerbaijan proposes that the parties mutually accept each other's territorial integrity in the peace agreement.\n\nBut first, the Armenian Constitutional Court must ratify the agreement. The same court initially authorizes the agreement but may declare that it cannot be interpreted as violating the Declaration of Independence and the constitution.\n\nAssume that all of the current constitutional court members are Pashinyan-appointed judges who recognize the agreement without objections.\n\nIt is also accepted by parliament because the ruling party has the majority of seats.\n\nBut as long as Armenia's present declaration of independence and constitution include territorial claims against Türkiye and Azerbaijan, the peace agreement will remain in jeopardy if the government in Armenia changes and radicals take power. In this case, any political party or organization can start a lawsuit against the agreement signed with Azerbaijan because it is unconstitutional, and the signed agreement might be declared null and void.\n\nBenefits of a new constitution\n\nRewriting the constitution would also be a politically beneficial move for Armenia. Armenia remained out of regional projects after making territorial claims against its neighbors and occupying one of its neighboring territories.\n\nThe defeat in the 2020 war freed Armenia from its territorial adventure around Karabakh. But the opposition in Armenia has already started taking action against the possible constitutional referendum.\n\nPublic opinion polls reveal that the majority of Armenians are against the removal of territorial claims against Azerbaijan and Türkiye from the constitution.\n\nTherefore, it will not be easy for incumbent Pashinyan to change the constitution. But rewriting the constitution would cause a conceptual change at governmental and public levels toward Türkiye and Azerbaijan, which is one of the most important obstacles to normalization.\n\nThis can lead to a wider change in Armenia and the region, as it would open up a path toward normalization with Türkiye and Azerbaijan and wider regional cooperation.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency.",

      "content": "US Senator Bob Menendez has come under the limelight recently amid growing calls for his resignation after federal prosecutors charged him and his wife with taking bribes from three businesspeople in New Jersey – his own state.\n\nAmid the allegations of corruption, his longstanding anti-Türkiye stance has also been questioned due to his close ties to the Greek and Armenian lobbies in the US, both of which are financially powerful groups with considerable political clout.\n\nMenendez is also known for his utterly pro-Armenia stance remained unchanged throughout the years he’s been in the Senate.\n\nIn August 2007, then-US President George W. Bush’s administration withdrew the nomination of Richard Hoagland for the position of Ambassador to Armenia due to the fact that Menendez, then a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had placed a hold on the nomination do to Hoagland’s “unwillingness to acknowledge” the events of 1915 as a “genocide” – a charge Türkiye vehemently denies.\n\nIn Dec. 2019, Menendez co-authored the “Promoting American National Security and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act” in “direct congressional response to Turkey’s military incursion into northeast Syria and attack on the Kurds, as well as their purchase of the Russian S-400 defense system.”\n\nEven though Türkiye was the first country ever to fight Daesh terror on the ground with its own troops, Menendez called Turkish actions in Syria “destabilizing” and called for support to “Syrian Kurds” – or rather, members of US-recognized terrorist group PKK’s Syrian wing YPG.\n\n“From purchasing the Russian S-400 air defense system to engaging in offensive operations in Syria against the Kurds, and committing, directing or knowingly facilitating human rights abuses against our Kurdish allies in Syria, the Foreign Relations Committee is saying enough is enough to [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan with this strong sanctions package,” he said in a statement – also calling for a “Special Immigrant Visa Program” for YPG terrorists.\n\nIn the same month, Menendez also spearheaded efforts to make the US government recognize the events of 1915 as a “genocide.”\n\n“By passing my Armenian Genocide resolution, the Senate finally stood up to confirm history: What happened from 1915 to 1923 was – most assuredly – genocide. There is no other word for it. There is no euphemism. There is no avoiding it,” said Menendez in complete denial of historical facts that show both sides, namely Turks and Armenians, suffered casualties amid the complexities of World War I. Türkiye has called to set up a joint committee of historians to probe the matter countless times, always falling on deaf ears.\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2020, Menendez again called for recognition of 1915 events as “Armenian genocide.”\n\n“Leading academic authorities, including experts on genocide issues, all agree that the Armenian Genocide was a genocide,” he claimed.In March 2020, Menendez again issued another anti-Türkiye statement, this time criticizing the country’s purchase of Russian S-400 anti-missile defense systems.\n\n“Countries whose spending violates the spirit of the NATO alliance and puts member states at significant physical risk should be punished; they should certainly not be rewarded. As I said on the Senate floor in November 2019, I remain deeply concerned that the administration has not imposed sanctions on Turkey for this sale. Not only are you violating the law by refusing to impose mandatory sanctions under CAATSA, but you are also sending a signal to other would-be purchasers of major Russian systems that the United States will not enforce its own laws when it comes to Russia-origin equipment,” Menendez said in a letter to then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nWhat was glaringly hypocritical though was the fact that the country Menendez staunchly lobbies for in the Senate, NATO member Greece, also has a Russian missile defense system – the S-300.\n\nAgain in March 2020, Menendez delivered anti-Türkiye remarks with regards to the situation in Syria.\n\nDuring a senate hearing titled “Nine Years of Brutality: Assad’s Campaign Against the Syrian People,” Menendez criticized Türkiye’s efforts to realize a ceasefire in the country to stop the bloodshed.\n\n“We talk of humanitarian relief, and Russia and Turkey continue to calculate the implementation of yet another ‘ceasefire.’ But we need serious leadership and commitment,” he said.\n\n“Following the withdrawal of US troops last year, Turkey stepped up its military involvement, pouring more fuel onto a raging fire and undermining our ability to respond,” he said – even though Türkiye and US are on the same page with regards to the Syria’s Bashar Assad regime.\n\nA month prior to those statements though, he called for a ceasefire in Syria himself.\n\nIn a statement on Feb. 20, 2020, Menendez criticized the administration of former US President Donald Trump and blasted Türkiye for its presence in Syria.\n\n“President Trump’s green light to Erdogan to attack our Kurdish partners — who are on the frontlines of America’s counter-ISIS efforts — allowed these three players to advance their own interests at the expense of hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrian lives,” he said in reference to YPG terrorists that the US does not recognize as being the Syrian wing of the PKK.\n\n“Now is the time for an immediate ceasefire between Russia, the Syrian regime, and Turkey. Now is the moment for the Turkish government to realign its security interests with those of the United States and NATO allies against the murderous regimes it is fighting on the ground,” he added.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, the embattled senator issued a bipartisan statement alongside his Republican colleague Jim Risch on a Turkish court’s annulment of a 1934 Cabinet decree that had turned Hagia Sophia into a museum, paving the way for its use again as a mosque.\n\nThe move is a “deep affront to Christians around the world who look to Hagia Sophia as a shining light and deeply revered holy site,” the senators said in reference to the Turkish judiciary’s sovereign prerogative of choice.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2020, Menendez again took to the stage in apparent lobbying for Greece along with Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nThe senators criticized Türkiye’s drilling activities in the Mediterranean – with the only problem being with their criticism of the fact that it is entirely based on Greece’s unilateral exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claim that Türkiye does not recognize, citing its outrageously large size and near total omission of Türkiye from the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas despite the country’s thousands of kilometers long coastline.\n\n“The failure of the United States to act decisively at this critical time will only invite further Turkish escalation. Therefore, we urge you to take all appropriate measures to ensure Turkey removes its naval vessels from Greece’s EEZ and adheres to its international obligations,” the senators wrote in a letter to Pompeo.\n\n“In accordance with your prior statements, we ask you to call on Turkey to remove its ships from Greece’s EEZ and to resolve this matter in accordance with international law,” they said.\n\nMenendez has also criticized Türkiye’s support to Azerbaijan’s move to restore its territory in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is recognized as Azerbaijani territory by international laws.\n\n“As the regime in Baku, with Turkey's support, continues choosing a path of violence instead of a peaceful, negotiated process between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is long past time for this and all future administrations to halt this type of assistance,” he said in a statement issued on Nov. 4, 2021, calling for a halt to US military assistance to Azerbaijani government.\n\nNearly two weeks after this statement, Menendez again delivered remarks in criticism of Türkiye’s support of Azerbaijan’s retrieval of its rightful territories.\n\n“Under Erdogan, Turkey has engaged in unbridled aggression outside of its borders, in violation of NATO’s founding principles and international norms,” he said.\n\n“The historically and religiously significant city of Shushi now sits in Azerbaijani hands, and the security of many sacred Christian sites falls to President Aliyev and his backer Erdogan,” he also added in blatant denial of international law.",

      "content": "The Washington director of the largest Armenian lobby in the US has sparked controversy with social media posts apparently calling for the assassination of Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister.\n\n\"Years from now, children yet unborn will ask their grandfathers: 'Babig, what did you do when Artsakh was attacked?’” Aram Suren Hamparian, director of the Armenian National Committee of America in Washington, wrote on Facebook, using the name for an unrecognized breakaway area of the Karabakh region, which is internationally recognized as the territory of Armenia’s neighbor Azerbaijan.\n\nHamparian continued: “Did you defend our homeland, did you protect our people?' Far too many – many of them cops reaping robust cash bonuses today – will stare down at their shoes in shame and either mumble a lie or admit: 'I defended Nikol Pashinyan against his own people'.\"\n\nLater, Hamparian called on Pashinyan's bodyguards to take action, when, in his words, \"an Armenian guarding Pashinyan values his souls more than his paycheck.\"\n\nHamparian's posts sparked debate among social media users, with one user voicing support for Pashinyan, saying, \"You’re inciting against Pashinyan who’s doing his best to get a peaceful solution for Artsakh (Karabakh),\" which saw provocations by Armenian fighters in recent months and years.\n\nAnother said: \"This is a shameful message unbecoming of a head of an Armenian American political group. Calling for an assassination of an elected leader of a country that is a partner of the U.S. is incompatible with American values, no matter how you feel about that leader’s actions. Violence has no place in politics.”\n\nYet another user expressed concern about the stability of the Armenian state and called for the police to take action against opposition leaders protesting on the streets. They also called on the Armenian Foreign Ministry to keep a close eye on external efforts to disrupt the country.\n\nArmenia has a large diaspora with what many observers call an outsized influence on domestic affairs in the landlocked Caucasian country.\n\nMeanwhile, in Armenia, eight individuals, including seven members of the “Crusaders' Military-Patriotic Society,” were detained on Sunday on allegations of attempting to seize power by force and planning to assassinate Pashinyan and other members of the government, according to the Armenian National Security Service.\n\n- ANCA: Ties to terrorism, violence\n\nThe Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) is known for its efforts to officially recognize Armenian claims regarding the events of 1915 throughout the US and, if possible, impose sanctions on Türkiye.\n\nThe suggestions of violence in the social media posts are not uncharacteristic for ANCA, which is also known for its links with Armenian terrorist groups and terrorists operating in the US.\n\nMourad Topalian, who had ties to the organization since the 1970s while serving as its chairman, was arrested in 1999 on weapons and explosives charges and sentenced to prison in 2001.\n\nANCA has continued its support for Armenian terrorist groups even in recent years. The organization made significant efforts to secure the release of Armenian terrorist Hampig Sassounian, who in 1982 assassinated Kemal Arikan, the Turkish consul general in Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 2021, California Governor Gavin Newsom directly informed ANCA of his decision to release Sassounian.\n\nNora Hovsepian, chairwoman of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region, expressed gratitude for the decision, stating: \"Were truly grateful to Governor Newsom for this decision.\"\n\nDespite Türkiye being one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991, the two countries have been divided on a range of issues, including Yerevan's occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the events of 1915 during the reign of the Ottoman Empire, and the border closure between the two neighboring countries since 1993.\n\nIn 2021, Ankara and Yerevan appointed special representatives to normalize ties.\n\nLast week, in the wake of provocations by Armenian forces in Karabakh, Azerbaijan said it had launched \"counter-terrorism\" activities in the region to uphold a 2020 trilateral peace agreement with Russia and Armenia. After 24 hours, a cease-fire was reached in the region.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, Azerbaijan liberated several cities, villages, and settlements in Karabakh from nearly 30 years of Armenian occupation. The war ended that November with a Russia-brokered cease-fire.\n\nTensions between the two nations, however, continue despite ongoing talks aiming for a long-term peace deal.\n\nPashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev are set to meet on Oct. 5 in the Spanish city of Granada to discuss the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries.",

      "content": "The author is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Politics at the University of York whose work focuses on post-Soviet politics and Central Asia\n\nThe prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, announced in recent months that the government had stopped their attempts to impose Armenian claims on the 1915 events in the international arena and that they expect the same attitude from the Armenian diaspora. Especially after the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, a softening and normalization process had begun between Armenia with Türkiye and Azerbaijan. Positive developments in relations progressed until Pashinyan's attendance at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inauguration ceremony this June. The positive views of the parties towards the current status quo in the region gave hope for regional peace. However, the debates triggered by the Armenian lobby’s propaganda against the Ataturk TV series further revealed the distinction between Armenia and the Armenian diaspora.\n\nDisney's digital streaming platform, Disney+, made a strong impression on Turkish audiences when it launched in Türkiye in June 2022, by announcing the production of an Ataturk TV series, which resulted in a significant bump in subscribers. However, in recent months, the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) openly insulted Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Republic of Türkiye, on social media and initiated a campaign against the platform due to the production of the series. Shortly after this campaign, local Turkish productions were removed from the website, leading to speculation the Ataturk series had been cancelled. In response to this backlash, the company clarified that the series was not cancelled and would be shown on Fox TV on Oct. 29 and then in movie theaters.\n\nDisney+’s decision to broadcast the Ataturk series exclusively on a channel accessible only from Türkiye, rather than on a global platform, has sparked a growing backlash from the Turkish public. In particular, the fact that the decision was taken under pressure from the Armenian lobby roiled the debate. Turkish users took to social media to say they were cancelling their Disney+ subscriptions. Additionally, the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) announced that they will investigate the issue and ask Disney to explain itself. Political party representatives also blasted the Armenian lobby over the issue and cautioned Disney+ to reconsider the decision. The ANCA, on the other hand, announced that their campaign was successful, and they were satisfied with the decision taken by Disney.\n\nThe Armenian diaspora exerts significant influence in France and Russia, but is considered most organized and effective in the United States due to the opportunities provided by the American political system. The Armenian lobby has seen an increase in its political influence in America since the 1970s, and its presence became more pronounced in 1984 when all Armenian organizations in America united under the Armenian Assembly of America. Their population of approximately 700,000 in the U.S., characterized as a community belonging to Western religion and culture, has allowed them to gain support from American society. Described as a well-organized structure, the Armenian lobby has consistently maintained strong relations with the U.S. Congress.\n\nThough their financial resources and population in America are limited, Armenians have compensated for this situation. Especially their concentration in specific electoral districts and active involvement in election campaigns have turned the Armenian diaspora into an influential community in the U.S. The significant increase in the number of Armenian organizations and the various activities they organized increased the visibility of the Armenian lobby in the country in the early 2000s. Armenian lobbies in the United States seek to contribute to the development of Armenian culture, fostering cultural, historical, and religious ties between the Armenian community and American society, enabling Armenian-Americans’ full political participation in the political system, and actively engaging in domestic politics. The main purpose of this lobby is to reinforce the Armenian claims on the 1915 events and to influence the U.S. politicians and the public to take decisions against Türkiye’s interests.\n\nArmenia vs. Armenian lobby\n\nAs a result of the successful policy followed by Azerbaijan and Türkiye in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which started in September 2020 and lasted for 44 days, the Armenian occupation of the region came to an end. While Azerbaijan liberated its lands that had been occupied for 28 years, the status quo in the South Caucasus also changed. Following these developments, the softening and normalization process between Armenia with Türkiye and Azerbaijan started and continues. So why does the Armenian lobby take such an attitude in such a peace and diplomacy process that started years later?\n\nWith a population of 3 million and a troubled economy, Armenia has played an occupying role in Karabakh for years. Although Türkiye has taken steps towards normalization and peace with Armenia, the Armenian diaspora has always been an obstacle. Despite the hardships faced by the Armenian people, the Armenian warlords in the West wanted the war in Karabakh to continue and the hostility towards Türkiye and Azerbaijan to increase. The Diaspora Ministry in Armenia has been a tool of pressure for Armenian politicians. The Armenian diaspora, which is far from both historical and regional realities, has set the course of Armenian politics for many years. Pashinyan's efforts to distance the diaspora from Armenian politics by following a more realistic policy in recent years led to friction between these two sides.\n\nMustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Republic of Türkiye, is a hero and significant value for Turkish society. The backlash from the public and government officials after Disney's decision clearly show this. Therefore, in response to the lobby that continues to exist as a hate community against Türkiye, more prudent decisions are expected from international companies such as Disney.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu.​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Türkiye's foreign minister on Monday said the Lachin road, the only land route giving Armenia access to the Karabakh region, is Azerbaijan's territory and that Baku can take any measure on it.\n\n\"Lachin road is Azerbaijan's territory. Therefore, Azerbaijan takes whatever measures it deems necessary. Taking (measures) is also one of its greatest sovereign rights.\n\n\"We see that Azerbaijan is making every effort there on humanitarian considerations. Medical transitions are also possible. Other routes, which are suitable for extensive material transport, have also been allocated. When we look at all these evaluations, we think that there is no justification for criticizing Azerbaijan on this issue,\" Hakan Fidan said at a news conference with his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov in the capital Ankara.\n\nAzerbaijan has called on countries and international organizations that have made anti-Azerbaijani statements to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, especially concerning developments in Karabakh and the Lachin road.\n\nDespite ongoing talks on a peace agreement following a war in 2020, tensions between Baku and Yerevan have risen in recent months concerning the Lachin road, as well as Azerbaijan’s establishment of a border checkpoint on the road.\n\nFidan said it is \"extremely important\" that the peace talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia come to a conclusion.\n\nThe minister added that agreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan should be signed soon, adding: \"This represents a great opportunity for other countries in the region.\"\n\nAbout the key Zangezur corridor land route in the southern Caucasus, Fidan said its opening is “vital”.\n\n\"The road to regional stability is through a comprehensive peace agreement. For this, the opening of the Zangezur corridor is of great importance,\" he added.\n\nThe minister also called on the international community not to discriminate between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\n\"Do not discriminate between parties, support peace. Don't be a hindrance instead of a support,\" he added.\n\nThe Zangezur region was originally part of Azerbaijan, though the Soviets gave it to Armenia in the 1920s, leaving Azerbaijan deprived of a direct overland route to its exclave of Nakhchivan.\n\nFollowing its 44-day war with Armenia in fall 2020, Azerbaijan has focused on planned connections including motorways and a 43-kilometer (26.7-mile) railway through the corridor.\n\nThe corridor would be near or adjacent to Armenia’s border with Iran, reportedly making Tehran concerned the project might cut off its frontier with Yerevan.\n\nOn Türkiye's normalization process with Armenia, Fidan said dialogue continues on what steps should be taken with respect to relations between the two nations.\n\n\"Our belief is that the agreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan should be signed as soon as possible,\" he said, expressing hope that economic, stability, and development process in the Caucasus starts right away, with Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and Armenia at the center.\n\nDespite Türkiye being one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991, the two countries have been divided on a range of issues, including Yerevan's occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the events of 1915 during the reign of the Ottoman Empire and the border closure between the two neighboring countries since 1993.\n\nIn 2021, Ankara and Yerevan appointed special representatives to normalize ties.\n\nOIC meeting on desecrations of Quran\n\nThe Turkish foreign minister also commented on a recent string of attacks on the Muslim holy book, the Quran.\n\nFidan said he held phone calls over the weekend with his counterparts from Sweden, Tobias Billstrom, and Denmark, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, to convey Ankara's concerns over the Quran burnings, and urged them to take concrete steps.\n\n\"The fact that the member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) were meeting solely on this subject was a great diplomatic message in essence.\n\n\"Here, we see this; after these phone calls, both countries made a written statement at the government level, not at the ministerial level,\" he added.\n\nTürkiye understands that they are beginning to see the potential harm and threats posed by this problem, he said.\n\n\"In particular, the Swedish prime minister's (Ulf Kristersson) written statement includes the following: 'We are experiencing the most serious security situation after World War II.'\n\n\"This is important. Allowing provocation on such a sensitive issue in your own country and the inability of the system and organs you established to prevent this brings along some problems related to the existence of a state together with its institutions,\" Fidan stressed.\n\nTürkiye will wait and watch whether these countries take steps to prevent such attacks on the Quran, Fidan said, adding: \"but in this process, we will continue to do what is necessary.\"\n\nLater on Monday, Fidan will attend an online meeting of OIC member states' foreign ministers concerning repeated acts of \"provocative desecration\" of the Quran in Sweden and Denmark.\n\n\"The meeting will take into consideration the increasing Islamophobia in Europe and the possible concrete steps to be taken against this phenomenon and to establish a common position within in the OIC against these heinous attacks,\" according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.\n\nRecent months have seen repeated acts of Quran burning or desecration, or attempts to do so, by Islamophobic figures or groups, especially in northern European and Nordic countries.\n\nBilateral ties with Azerbaijan\n\nWith Bayramov, Fidan said they discussed bilateral relations and regional issues, in detail.\n\n\"Our economic relations are pleasing. Our mutual investments are over $30 billion. While we are advancing our cooperation in the field of energy, we are working within a holistic strategy based on common interests,\" he added.\n\nTürkiye-Azerbaijan energy cooperation has turned from a matter that only serves the interests of the two countries to a more strategic level, Fidan said, adding: \"In this context, we also contribute to the energy security of Europe.\"\n\nWith the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, an energy crisis on the global level was experienced, he said.\n\n\"Meanwhile, there may be a new crisis in Europe next winter. For this reason, uncertainties in the energy markets continue. There are problems not only in supply quantities, but also in price stability,\" the minister added.\n\n\"Türkiye's strategic dialogue and preparations for these issues continue with Azerbaijan for the coming years,\" Fidan said.",

      "content": "Full normalization of ties between Armenia, Azerbaijan and Türkiye will create new opportunities for the Caucasus region, said the Turkish defense minister.\n\nIn an article for TRT World, Hulusi Akar said that “hopefully, reversing historical enmities will pave the way for lasting friendship and cooperation.”\n\n“However, we must be mindful of the delicate situation at hand. While the conflict is currently frozen, the threat of falling back into hostilities grows the longer it takes to hammer out a deal,” he said.\n\nAkar said two issues have prevented Ankara and Yerevan from developing normal ties since Armenia’s independence from the Soviet Union. One was the “the war in 1992 over Nagorno-Karabakh and the consequent occupation, in violation of international law, of a substantial amount of Azerbaijani territories by Armenia.”\n\n“The other obstacle is the unresolved differing perspectives on the historic events of 1915 that led to the deaths of both Armenians and Muslims in the final years of the Ottoman Empire,” he said.\n\nWhile the first one has more or less been resolved, with Azerbaijan regaining its lands in 2020 after three decades of Armenian occupation, the second one “has proven far more difficult to surmount, as it is a deeply emotional and sensitive topic for both sides,” said Akar.\n\nTürkiye is keen to resolve this issue and called on Armenia in 2005 to open its national archives and establish a joint committee of historians to research the events of 1915, said Akar, adding “Türkiye has already opened its national archives to international scrutiny, but Armenia still keeps its archives closed and refuses to respond to our call.”\n\n“During the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was attacked by Russia on its eastern front, emboldening Armenian nationalists to take up arms and engage in acts of violence against Muslims, including attacks on Muslim villages and civilians. These acts have been documented and acknowledged by historians as well as by Western military missions at the time,” he said.\n\nHe also said that American General James Guthrie Harbord’s report on the events of that time “also documented the atrocities committed by Armenians, who did not constitute a majority in any region of the Ottoman lands, against other subjects of the empire.”\n\n“This is not to disregard the massive humanitarian crises that took place during this period. (Turkish) President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan back in 2014 – then the prime minister – expressed his condolences to the descendants of the Armenians who lost their lives in that period,” said Akar.\n\nAkar said that Türkiye remains steadfast in its belief that the Turkish and Armenian people, who have a long history of living in tolerance and peace, can establish relations based on friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation, despite the challenges.\n\n“If the countries in the region and beyond choose to invest in peace, the political and economic dividends will be high for the entire region. Türkiye would like to see third countries – including its allies in the West – either help usher in this new understanding or be at least wary of efforts to politicize a historical controversy and perpetuate hostilities,” he added.\n\n* https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/the-caucasus-region-a-unique-opportunity-for-peace-and-reconciliation-13081129",

Of course, many countries gave Ukraine heavy weapons, especially tanks ... Therefore, serious conflicts await us for this region,\" he added.\n\nEmphasizing that Türkiye does not want the tension in the region to escalate or the war to flare up, the minister said: \"Of course, such a conflict or the growth of tension has a negative effect on everyone, everyone will feel the effect of war as it has until today, this is inevitable.\"\n\nHe added that Türkiye is working for a solution of the war via diplomacy and aims to bring the two sides on the table.\n\nPointing out that a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Türkiye or by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Moscow is not planned, Cavusoglu said Erdogan frequently speaks with Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nTürkiye, internationally praised for its mediator role between Ukraine and Russia, has repeatedly urged Kyiv and Moscow to end the war, which began last year in February, through negotiations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nNormalization process with Armenia\n\nOn a question of opening border with Armenia and mutual appointment of ambassadors, Cavusoglu said: \"It may not be in the near future, we need to take other steps first.\"\n\nUnderlining that the process between Azerbaijan and Armenia is also important, he said Türkiye has provided all its support for the signing of a permanent peace agreement.\n\nDespite Türkiye being one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991, the two countries have been divided on a range of issues, including Yerevan's occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the events of 1915 during the reign of the Ottoman Empire and the border closure between the two neighboring countries since 1993.\n\nIn 2021, Ankara and Yerevan appointed special representatives to normalize ties.\n\n'Positive atmosphere with Greece needs to be permanent'\n\nCavusoglu said that in order for the positive atmosphere with Greece to be permanent, steps should be taken to solve complex problems that have not been resolved for years, and the positive atmosphere should be maintained.\n\nDrawing attention to the necessity of abandoning tensions and violations in the Aegean Sea, he said: \"We need to prioritize cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean. We have no eyes on anyone's right. We will always protect our own rights and the rights of the people of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\"\n\nThe minister said that attempts such as not holding military exercises during the tourism season despite all the tensions would be a mutual gesture and would show that reconciliation is possible.\n\nAbout the anchoring of the US attack submarine USS San Juan at a Greek Cypriot port, Cavusoglu said: \"Recently, submarine anchored at a port. In this sense, we see that they disrupt the balance.\"\n\nThe minister said if the US wants to act as an \"honest\" mediator between Türkiye and Greece, it needs to be \"more objective and balanced.\"",

They should know that,\" he said.\n\nStressing that Ankara does not seek to acquire the territory or sovereignty of any country, Erdogan said Türkiye was only fighting to protect its interests and those of Turkish Cypriots.\n\nOn Cyprus, he underlined that the \"only key\" to a solution on the East Mediterranean island was the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot people's sovereign equality and equal international status with the Greek Cypriot administration.\n\n\"For a permanent solution, the facts on the Island must be accepted,\" he added.\n\nWarming ties with Armenia\n\nTurning to his meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Erdogan said their talk was held in a \"friendly atmosphere.\"\n\n\"I sincerely believe that we can achieve our goal of full normalization on the basis of good neighborly relations in our region,\" he said.\n\nDespite Türkiye being one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991, the two countries have been divided on a range of issues, including Yerevan's occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the events of 1915 during the reign of the Ottoman Empire and the border closure between the two neighboring countries since 1993.\n\nIn 2021, Ankara and Yerevan mutually appointed special representatives to normalize ties.\n\nErdogan said the two countries' foreign ministers and special representatives will gather and take the step to a further level.\n\n\"We want to warm up relations between Türkiye-Armenia-Azerbaijan as soon as possible and solve this issue,\" he added.\n\nErdogan told Pashinyan that Türkiye has no preconditions for this, adding: \"As soon as you make a peace agreement with Azerbaijan, we will have no problem.\"\n\nGrain shipments beneficial for all of Europe\n\nErdogan said the Istanbul grain deal and Russia-Ukraine prisoner swap are diplomatic successes for Türkiye despite all difficulties.\n\nTürkiye, the UN, Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement in Istanbul on July 22 to resume grain exports from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports which were paused after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in February.\n\nA Joint Coordination Center with officials from the three countries and the UN was set up in Istanbul to oversee the shipments.\n\nErdogan said that since the first ship left Ukraine under the deal on Aug. 1, over 6 million tons of agricultural products have left ports.\n\n\"The continuation of the grain shipments in the upcoming period will be to the benefit of the people of Ukraine, all of Europe and the world,\" Erdogan said.\n\nThe president also stressed that Russian fertilizers should be supplied to countries in need via Türkiye.\n\n\"We care about the issues of grain and fertilizer as much as the exchange of prisoners. Tomorrow, we will have a phone call with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and evaluate these matters,\" he added.\n\nTurning to Sweden and Finland's NATO bids, Erdogan said: \"As long as the marches of terrorist organizations continue in Sweden and these terrorists are present in the parliament, our stance on Sweden will not be positive.\"\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO in June, a decision spurred by Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Türkiye voiced objections to the membership bids, criticizing the countries for tolerating and even supporting terrorist groups.\n\nA trilateral memorandum at the NATO summit signed among the countries in June stipulates that Finland and Sweden will not provide support to the YPG/PYD, the PKK's Syrian offshoot, or to the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) -- the group behind the 2016 defeated coup in Türkiye.\n\n'No meeting with Syria's Assad at the moment'\n\nUpon a question about a possible meeting with Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Erdogan said: \"As of now, of course, such a thing is out of the question,\" adding talks continue at a low level.\n\nHowever, Erdogan hinted that he might meet with him in the future.\n\n\"Our only desire is to clear the terrorist groups from Syria,\" he added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly stressed that Türkiye will continue its efforts to destroy a \"corridor\" that terrorists are attempting to build along its border.\n\nHe added that since Türkiye's cross-border operations in Syria began in 2016, approximately 550,000 uprooted Syrians in Türkiye had voluntarily returned to the resulting safe zones in their country.",

Memories of the massacres and cruelties committed by Armenian gangs all over our country are still alive.\"\n\nHe added: \"Although the Armenian propaganda expresses absurd numbers, it is a fact that many more Muslims than Armenians who lost their lives in Anatolia were brutally martyred by these gangs.

Some banners read \"History cannot be judged by politics\" and \"We reject Armenian lies\" while others expressed peace between Turkiye and Armenia.\n\nThe demonstrators also called on President Joe Biden’s administration not to use the 1915 events as a political tool, while voicing discomfort with the distortion of historical events.\n\nTurkish Ambassador to the US Hasan Murat Mercan hosted a group photo with the participants at the end of the gathering.\n\nLast year, Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking with the long-held tradition of US presidents of refraining from using the term.

Ankara hopes to resolve this issue, as well, he said.\n\nOn a strategic mechanism to be established with the US to improve relations, Cavusoglu said he would hold talks with his American counterpart Antony Blinken on May 18 and that the mechanism should be solution-oriented.\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\nTurning to the hydrocarbon-rich Eastern Mediterranean, Cavusoglu said this region had become even more significant after the eruption of the Russia-Ukraine war, with questions arising on the EU's energy security and dependence.\n\nThough some groups have sought to isolate Ankara, recent developments have proven these attempts fruitless, he said, asserting that rich energy reserves off Israel could be transported to Europe through Turkiye as the most economical route.\n\n\"Steps can be taken on fair sharing, everyone can win,\" he said.\n\nRelations with Egypt, Saudi Arabia\n\nWhile Turkiye and Egypt do not have to see eye-to-eye on every issue, their positive relations have had repercussions on various regions, be it the Eastern Mediterranean, the Muslim world, Arab countries, Africa, or the Middle East.\n\nBoth sides are willing to normalize relations and talks will continue, Cavusoglu said.\n\nAnother country in the region with whom Turkiye is normalizing ties with is Saudi Arabia, he added, noting that high-level meetings were likely to happen in the future.\n\nNormalizing ties with Armenia\n\nOn the Southern Caucasus region, Cavusoglu underscored that Turkiye values the ongoing talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which once fought each other in a war in 2020.\n\nCountries in the Southern Caucasus should normalize ties as this would benefit the entire region, he said, noting that Vienna would host talks between Turkish and Armenian special representatives in a third meeting since the two countries launched efforts at normalizing their strained relations.\n\nHowever, these efforts have been met with opposition from the Armenian diaspora, especially in France and the US, he added.\n\nHowever, Cavusoglu questioned the need to hold meetings in third countries, noting that Turkiye had wanted the first round of talks to be in the Armenian capital Yerevan.\n\n\"On the one hand, you say: 'Let's normalize relations overnight and open the borders.' On the other, you don't even dare hold talks in Turkiye or Yerevan. I mean, if you don't even favor talks in your own country, how will you take steps on other issues?\" he asked.\n\nLong divided by such issues as borders and the events of 1915, Turkiye and Armenia last December named special envoys to discuss the normalization of ties. Two rounds of talks followed on Jan. 14 and then on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its war on Ukraine, an issue that has dominated the global agenda ever since.",

      "content": "Newly thawing relations between Turkiye and Armenia are \"at a turning point,\" said a US-born Armenian political analyst after a historic meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers.​​​​​​​\n\nSpeaking to Anadolu Agency on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, which Anadolu Agency is the global communication partner, Richard Giragosian, head of the Regional Studies Center (RSC) think tank in Yerevan, said Armenia's Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan’s visit to the event was an “indication of the strategic significance that Turkey offers an important platform for international diplomacy.”\n\n“The second reason I'm optimistic is after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we have a new geopolitical landscape and the emphasis on diplomacy over the force of arms is a shared objective of both Turkey and Armenia,” he said. “And after earlier meetings between Turkey and Armenia in Moscow then Vienna, this represents a continuation to sustain the momentum.”\n\nA historic meeting took place Saturday between Turkiye’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan, on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. It was the first high-level visit to Turkiye from Armenia after many years.\n\nCavusoglu told reporters that the meeting was \"extremely fruitful and constructive.\"​​​​​​​\n\nAccording to Giragosian, there is a much more “important demonstration of goodwill on both sides.”\n\n“However, the coming challenge is on Turkiye and Armenia to focus now on practical steps to implement expectations of normalization, the reopening of the border and establishing diplomatic relations,” he said. “And in this context, we need to remind both sides that we don't have the luxury of time in this war environment in Ukraine.”\n\nHe said that there is no “real progress on crucial details of the implementation of normalization.”\n\nHowever, he added: “What we see now is a turning point.”\n\nEffects of Russia-Ukraine war on normalization process\n\nGiragosian said Antalya is the “last preliminary stage of the opening round of negotiations.”\n\n“What we expect next are concrete firm proposals from both sides to actually begin the implementation second stage,” he said. “Having said that, we still have despite the war in Ukraine, Russia not blocking the process, and Azerbaijan still contend with allowing normalization.”\n\n“But this is a bilateral process between Turkiye and Armenia. Hence, the need for the next meetings to return to the region itself.”\n\nTurkish-Armenian normalization process\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkiye was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia’s independence on Sept. 21, 1991.\n\nBut following the 1993 occupation by Armenian forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory, the border between the two countries was closed, a condition that has remained to this day. There are other contentious issues, including the events of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOn Oct. 10, 2009, the two countries signed a peace accord, known as the Zurich Protocols, to establish diplomatic relations and open the border but failed to ratify the agreement in their respective national parliaments.\n\nFast forward to the fall of 2020 and the end of the 44-day second Nagorno-Karabakh war, which helped Azerbaijan recapture its territory and put Turkish-Armenian relations in a new phase.\n\nSpecial representatives from Turkiye and Armenia, Serdar Kilic and Ruben Rubinyan, first met Jan. 14 in Moscow and the second meeting was held in Vienna on Feb. 24, after which both sides \"reiterated their agreement to continue the process without preconditions.\"",

      "content": "Undeniable proof of the Khojaly genocide, in which hundreds of Azerbaijanis were killed by Armenian forces 30 years ago, has been demonstrated to the world and must continue to be shown, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Turkiye said on Thursday.In an opening speech at a workshop in Ankara on the legal aspect of the \"war crimes\" committed by Armenian forces in the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, Resad Mammadov said, \"Armenia is guilty of war crimes\" in the town of Khojaly on Feb. 26, 1992.\"Today's ceremony is not a memorial service. Today's ceremony is a meeting where academics, teachers, experts, and politicians gather and evaluate the war crimes that have been committed by Armenia against Azerbaijani people in Khojaly,\" said Mammadov.Describing the events in Khojaly as a \"genocide,\" he stressed that the entire world remained silent on the issue despite all the facts that have since come to light.\"Armenia and its politicians occupied Azerbaijani lands for 30 years, caused 1 million people to live away from their homeland for 30 years, and carried out the Khojaly genocide with a fascist ideology,\" said Mammadov.Underlining that Turkiye had always \"stood by Azerbaijan, giving its full support and sharing our grief,\" the ambassador said Yerevan was today \"slandering our beloved Turkiye and making the events of 1915 a priority of the domestic and foreign politics of their own state, claiming that it is a 'genocide.'\"Turkiye's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.Turkiye objects to the presentation of these incidents as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\"Every year, before the anniversary of the so-called 'genocide', this issue is raised on all social media channels, world media, world parliaments and is used as a means of pressuring both Turkiye and Azerbaijan,\" asserted Ambassador Mammadov.Ankara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkiye and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.In 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was Turkiye's prime minister at the time, expressed condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.Mammadov also underlined the need to show the world the \"undeniable and solid proof\" of the Khojaly genocide.\"We have to tell it to the politicians, young population, and all other countries that this murder was a genocide.\"Despite the time that has passed since the Khojaly genocide, it has yet to be \"legally evaluated worldwide,\" said Aygun Attar, the chairwoman of the Turkish-Azerbaijani Friendship Cooperation and Solidarity Foundation (TADIV).Also, delivering an opening speech at the workshop, which TADIV helped organize along with the Azerbaijani Embassy in Ankara, Attar emphasized that such an evaluation must be conducted and urged people to raise awareness of the mass killing.\"I express my gratitude to everyone who has accepted and shared our pain as their own,\" she said.Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nOn Feb. 26, 1992, with the Soviet Union just dissolved, Armenian forces took over the town of Khojaly in occupied Karabakh after battering it using heavy artillery and tanks, assisted by infantry.The genocide is seen as one of the bloodiest atrocities by Armenian forces against Azerbaijani civilians in the Upper Karabakh region, which was liberated by Azerbaijan forces in fall 2020 after decades of occupation.The two-hour Armenian offensive on Khojaly killed 613 Azerbaijani citizens -- including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly people -- and seriously injured 487 others, according to Azerbaijani figures.Some 150 of the 1,275 Azerbaijanis that the Armenians captured during the genocide remain missing. In the genocide, eight families were completely wiped out, while 130 children lost one parent and 25 children lost both parents.Relations between the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Upper Karabakh, a territory recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and seven adjacent regions.New clashes erupted on Sept. 27, 2020, and ended with a Russian-brokered truce six weeks later.Baku liberated several strategic cities and nearly 300 of its settlements and villages from Armenian occupation during this time.Before this, about 20% of Azerbaijan's territory had been under illegal Armenian occupation for nearly three decades.",

It was followed by the resumption of flights after a two-year hiatus and Armenia’s lifting of a ban on Turkish imports.\n\nAhead of 2nd meeting in Vienna\n\nThe special representatives from Turkiye and Armenia, Serdar Kilic and Ruben Rubinyan, first met on Jan. 14 in Moscow, and the next meeting is set to be held in Vienna on Thursday.\n\nAs Rubinyan and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan have also been invited to the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkiye, set for March 11-13, but have yet to confirm their attendance, all eyes are on the meeting in the Austrian capital.\n\nIn recent weeks, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and speak to a variety of people, including traders and academics, and my colleagues at Anadolu Agency spoke to businesspeople in Turkish border cities, who see the normalization of relations as a win-win situation.\n\nDespite differences, many agree that the opening of the borders and railways between Turkiye and Armenia would bring economic benefits to both sides. Shopkeepers in border cities such as Kars, Igdir, and Gyumri are especially eager to grab the opportunity.\n\nWhile some retailers in the Armenian border city of Gyumri urged caution in terms of competition with Turkish goods and its risks for domestic industry, one shop owner told me that “trade brings people closer and brings peace.”\n\nMeanwhile, businesspeople in Turkiye’s eastern city of Kars, near the currently closed Dogu Kapi border gate, said they expected a “massive influx of tourists” from Armenia to their historical and religious sites if the ongoing efforts succeed, and a link between Kars and Armenia by road and railway is established.\n\nDespite the sealed borders, Turkish products make their way to Armenia by way of Georgia and Iran. The trade volume between Turkiye, with a population of over 83 million, and Armenia, with a population of 3 million, stood at $15.3 million in 2012-2021.\n\nSeveral Turkish clothing chains such as LC Waikiki, Koton, and Mavi also have locations in the Armenian capital.\n\nAnalysts I spoke to sounded optimistic about the historic bid by Turkiye and Armenia and stressed that normalization is not “reconciliation,” but rather the first step towards addressing issues concerning the two societies and two countries.\n\nResuming direct flights was hailed as a positive development by people from both sides, but they said that the real turning point would be the opening of the borders.\n\nPresident Erdogan said Wednesday on his way back from an Africa tour that \"If Armenia is determined to continue the process that started with the special representatives, for us keeping the doors closed will be out of the question.\" He added that Turkiye is in favor of a six-country regional cooperation platform, including Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, Georgia, and Iran, while also stressing that his country will continue the normalization process in \"close coordination\" with Azerbaijan.\n\nThe first meeting between the special representatives discussed a roadmap to normalize relations, and it is expected that opening of the land borders, resuming railway services, and establishing diplomatic relations could be next in line.\n\nOne can hope for a more positive and conducive atmosphere if the neighboring countries agree to establish trade and tourism relations and open borders to boost people-to-people contacts, which would, in turn, help them overcome the remaining political issues.",

I want us to have relationships, and I don’t want the third parties to talk instead of us,” he said.\n\nAlthough Yeghiazaryan is in favor of opening the border in terms of commercial relationships, he noted that his country does not have to “compromise” on some serious issues, including the 1915 incidents.\n\n“It's just really necessary for our future to heal. Turks and Armenians need to heal,” he said.He also underscored the importance of “fair trade,” adding that without this, “the bigger one can swallow the smaller one.”\n\nDespite being neighboring countries, Turkiye and Armenia have had many difficulties in diplomatic relations since Armenia declared its independence in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the border between the two countries has remained closed since 1993, when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory.\n\nNow, as the two countries hold talks to normalize relations, many wonder if the shuttered border will be opened.\n\nApin Chahoyan, a hairdresser at Gyumri’s oldest barbershop, with a history of over 70 years, said: “Two neighbors sharing the same wall cannot be hostile towards one another. So let them be good friends.”\n\n“This is neighborship. If you are asking my opinion, my opinion is that the more peace, the better,” he said.\n\n“There is nothing better than peace.”\n\nNorik Tonoyan, who has been working at the same barbershop, said: “I think it is wrong to remain hostile (towards one another) for centuries.”\n\n“If there is a mutually beneficial solution in terms of trade, then there is a future,” he added.According to Tonoyan, some “harmful things” happened for both sides, but “it is wrong to continue like this.”\n\n“It is necessary not to remain enemies for centuries,” he said. “Trade brings people closer and brings peace.”\n\nNoting that there are many places worth seeing and visiting in Gyumri, he said: “Let's be humanists in both cultural and commercial issues and not have animosity.”",

So far, 45 foreign ministers, plus government ministers and 50 ministers, have confirmed their participation. Six or seven ministers from the Latin American region are confirmed.\"\n\nThe annual forum will be held on March 11-13 under the theme of \"Recoding Diplomacy.\"\n\n\"Everyone regards (forum) this as a free platform,\" Cavusoglu said, noting that 30 representatives from international organizations, including the NATO Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, are to attend the ADF.\n\n\"In other words, let's bring diplomacy to the fore, let's bring the dialogue to the fore, let's discuss the existing problems, and reveal the visions for the future,\" he added.\n\nAbout relations with the Central African Republic, the Turkish minister underlined that a \"new page\" has opened.\n\n\"Today, we have made a decision to open mutual embassies in the upcoming period.

Three days later, Armenia appointed its special representative, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Ruben Rubinyan.\n\nBefore the meeting, Turkiye's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that at the gathering, the envoys would exchange views on a roadmap for moving forward, including confidence-building measures.\n\nIn that context, the two officials conducted the first meeting in \"a positive and constructive atmosphere\" as they had \"exchanged their preliminary views regarding the normalization process through dialogue between Turkiye and Armenia.\"\n\nA prominent geopolitics expert on the South Caucasus, Nigar Goksel, characterized the release of the same statement by both countries after the meeting as a \"positive first step\" even though it \"doesn't reveal much.\"\n\nGoksel, who is also the Turkish director of the International Crisis Group, added: \"Now that there is a direct channel, the risk that public messaging can be misinterpreted is diminished.\"\n\nShe said both parties \"share an interest in normalization\" and noted that mending ties would \"pave the way for regional integration, with transport links expected to bring economic dividends and more stability.\"\n\n\"The normalization process will likely proceed step by step, ideally building trust along the way between Turkiye and Armenia, and also ensuring all other neighbors are positively disposed of,\" she said.\n\nAlthough the opening of borders may still require some time, the International Crisis Group expert said, \"there is an expectation that now bilateral talks will continue in Ankara and Yerevan, rather than in a third country.\"\n\nRegarding Azerbaijan's position on Turkiye's talks with Armenia, Goksel said: \"Baku’s public statements are supportive, and this matters for Turkish public opinion.\"\n\nNoting that the opening of a new transit route to Nakhichevan via Armenian territory is particularly important for Baku and Ankara, she said normalization talks \"remain fragile\" as a potential \"escalation between Armenia and Azerbaijan could negatively affect Turkiye-Armenia negotiations.\"\n\n\"Ankara’s expressed hope is that momentum in Turkiye-Armenia talks can feed into a broader positive dynamic in the region,\" she added.\n\nYildiz Deveci Bozkus, a leading Turkish academician on Armenian studies from Ankara University, also told Anadolu Agency that the normalization process between Ankara and Yerevan is \"highly fragile.\"\n\nBozkus said the fact that Turkish and Armenian ministries shared identical statements is \"very important,\" as it shows that both parties \"are on the same page.\"\n\nThough the date and location of the next meeting were not announced, a prominent academician said the statement also \"gives clues on the continuation of a positive process.\"\n\nBoth parties sharing the same statement is also important to prevent manipulation, she said. But \"the process is very fragile, steps need to be taken very carefully.\"\n\n\"Public opinion emerged regarding this meeting both in the West and the East. In fact, especially when we look at the US, there are reports of (US President Joe) Biden receiving letters criticizing Turkiye on the talks and that the Armenian diaspora creating pressure. In this respect, we can say that the process is fragile,\" she said.\n\nStressing the importance of the continuation of negotiations without preconditions, Bozkus said such a move shows that \"the events of 1915 will be discussed in the next period, but not in the near future. As part of normalization steps, the opening of borders, energy, and transportation will be addressed in the first place. Meanwhile, the events of 1915 are either placed aside or postponed to a later date.\"\n\nShe noted that talks continuing without preconditions also had a backlash for Armenia as Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was criticized by radicals in that country as well as former politicians.\n\nBut having conditions before negotiations would not lead to results, she added.\n\nNoting that during previous negotiations there were third parties such as international organizations or countries, Bozkus said current talks are being carried out directly between Turkiye and Armenia.\n\n\"This process, unlike the previous ones, needs to be continued with more rigor and sensitivity so that both sides do not miss this opportunity for normalization,\" she said.\n\nBozkus also drew attention to the necessity of normalization of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, saying that success in talks between Ankara and Yerevan depends on it.\n\n\"Reopening of borders would benefit everyone, not only Turkiye or Armenia but will also have a positive effect on the region's trade route,\" she added.\n\nTurkiye and Armenia have long been divided on a number of issues, from Armenia's refusal to recognize their shared border to historical incidents with the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population in 1915, during World War I.",

      "content": "Despite being two neighboring countries, Turkiye and Armenia have seen ups and down in diplomatic relations since Yerevan’s declaring its independence in 1991.\n\nThe two countries have long been divided by a range of issues – from Armenia’s refusal to recognize their shared border to its occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and the 1915 events between the Ottoman Empire and Armenians.\n\nThe bilateral relations, however, have gained a new dimension towards normalization recently, with Turkish and Armenian special envoys scheduled to meet in Moscow on Jan. 14 to lead dialogue between Ankara and Yeravan.\n\nTurkiye was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia’s independence on Sept. 21, 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt sent humanitarian aid to Armenia that was struggling with serious economic problems after declaring its independence and helped Yerevan integrate with regional organizations, international community and the Western institutions.\n\nTurkiye invited Armenia to the Black Sea Economic Cooperation as a founding member.\n\nHowever, the bilateral relations deteriorated after Armenia’s occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory.\n\nTurkiye ended direct trade with Armenia in 1993 and the border between the two countries was closed.\n\nIn 2005, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkish prime minister, sent a letter to the then Armenian President Robert Kocharyan and proposed establishing a joint commission of historians to study the Ottoman-era incidents of 1915.\n\nKocharyan, instead, suggested a high-level political dialogue to normalize relations between the two countries.\n\nThen Turkish President Abdullah Gul congratulated Armenian counterpart Serzh Sargsyan over his 2008 election victory. In what was called “football diplomacy,” Sargsyan invited Gul to a 2008 World Cup qualifier match between Turkiye and Armenia in Yerevan.\n\nGul became the first Turkish president to visit Armenia after its independence.\n\nIt was only after one year that the Armenian president paid a visit to Turkiye’s northwestern Bursa province to join Gul at the second leg of the World Cup qualifier.\n\nHigh-level meetings continued when Erdogan and Sargsyan met in Washington on the sidelines of the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit.\n\n2009 Zurich protocols\n\nTurkiye and Armenia signed two protocols for the establishment of diplomatic ties and improvement of bilateral relations on Oct. 10, 2009 in Zurich, Switzerland, which were a “roadmap” for the re-establishment of bilateral ties.\n\nAccording to the protocols, the steps would include the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border two months after the protocol went into effect. The two countries also decided to establish committees in several fields and at various levels.\n\nArmenian diaspora, the church and the nationalist parties in the country reacted against the protocols.\n\nTurkiye sent the protocols to parliament for the approval, while they were submitted to the Constitutional Court in Armenia.\n\nAlthough the Armenian court ruled on Jan. 12, 2010 that the protocols could constitutionality be approved, it rejected one of the main premises of the protocols.\n\nAt the end, Sargsyan suspended the ratification process.\n\nAzerbaijan’s Karabakh victory\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia carried out attacks on Azerbaijani soldiers and civilians for almost 30 years from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the surrounding area.\n\nNew clashes erupted on Sept. 27, 2020, with the Armenian army attacking civilians and Azerbaijani forces and violating humanitarian cease-fire agreements.\n\nDuring the 44-day conflict, Azerbaijan liberated several cities and villages that were occupied by Armenia.\n\nA Russian-brokered agreement ended the fighting on Nov. 10, 2020.\n\nTurkiye has stood by Azerbaijan since the start of the war, with Azerbaijani President Aliyev thanking his Turkish counterpart Erdogan on every occasion.\n\nTowards normalization\n\nFollowing the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkish-Armenian relations have entered a new phase, with Erdogan saying Turkey is ready for dialogue with Armenia.\n\nAddressing Azerbaijan’s parliament on Jan 16, 2021, Erdogan said peace and stability in the Caucasus will benefit the entire world, not just countries of the region.\n\n“The opening of Turkiye’s borders to Armenia will bring innumerable benefits to the country,” he added.\n\nArmenia has acknowledged “positive signals” from the Turkish president, with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan saying: “We will evaluate these gestures and respond to positive signals with positive signals.”\n\nArmenia announced it would lift its embargo on Turkish imports as of January 2022.\n\nAlso Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu’s speech at the Turkish parliament on Dec. 13 signaled that a new era has begun in Turkiye-Armenia relations.\n\nOn Dec. 15, Turkiye appointed Serdar Kilic, a former ambassador to the US, as its special envoy to discuss steps towards normalization with Armenia.

There is also the diaspora abroad. A significant part of the diaspora unites around this so-called genocide (events of 1915), and there is a group that follows an anti-Turkey policy,\" he added.\n\nSaying that these extremist groups should not put pressure on Yerevan, Cavusoglu underlined that they have not seen a country that uses this diaspora to negatively affect the normalization process so far and that the US and European countries strongly support this process.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.\n\nA subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as “genocide,” describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was Turkey’s prime minister at the time, expressed condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.",

This year, we are here with our ambassador (Turkey's Ambassador in Washington Hasan Murat Mercan), our consul (Turkey's Consul General in Chicago Engin Turesin). We have other student friends. We held various meetings to represent our country as much as possible and to strengthen the relations between the American society and the prominent leaders of the society and Turkey. It was a very productive meeting.\n\nAs you know, Turkey has a special place for the American Muslim community because many of them come to Turkey. Some people come and invest, some come to Turkey for vacation or education programs. This place (convention) also provides a good environment for Turks living in the US to mingle with other Muslim communities. Here, of course, the American Muslim community is made up of extremely diverse elements, and their representatives are here in groups. Of course, the US is a big country, people are living in different ways in many different parts of the country. Of course, we have always cared about strengthening our ties with them. As you know, every time our president comes to the US, he always receives and talks with the leaders of the American society in New York if he is in New York, or Washington if he is in Washington, or in other cities he visits. We care about these relations in terms of our ties with the US in general, because the prominent representatives and leaders of the American Muslim community hold different positions in many fields from politics to the economy, from the media to local politics, and we care about strengthening relations with them for our country.\n\nForeign Ministry sent letter to US for joint mechanism\n\nQ: You talked about relations with the US. 2021 is about to be over and there has been a new administration in Washington for nearly a year. You have spoken to your counterpart many times. Can you evaluate the Turkish-American relations in 2021 to cover the approaches of the new administration?\n\nA: Now, Turkish-US relations have a long and deep-rooted history. Our relationship is defined at the strategic partnership level, we are also two allied countries within NATO. But we also witness that the US policies which do not take into account Turkey's national interests from time to time move away from this spirit of alliance. There are two to three main issues that overshadow and poison Turkish-US relations, on which we cannot agree. One of them is the support given to the PYD and YPG by the US administrations since the (former US President Barack) Obama period. We have said this support was a wrong policy from the very beginning, and we repeatedly state that it needs to be changed. Once support has been given to the PYD and YPG for the fight against Daesh (ISIS), you cannot eliminate a terrorist organization by supporting another terrorist organization in principle. Secondly, everyone knows that the YPG and PYD in Syria are the Syrian branches of the PKK. Americans know this too, others know as well. Thirdly, it should be underlined that it has created great discomfort, especially within the Syrian society. Because if you try to build a policy about Syria by pulling a group to your side -- in other words, only one ethnic group within the Syrian opposition and society, or a certain group from within that group that is a Kurdish group that supports the PKK or is a member of the PKK -- it is obvious that there will be great difficulties in terms of territorial integrity, political unity and future of Syria. This is one of our main issues of contention.\n\nSecondly, there are CAATSA (Combating America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions that are unfairly applied to Turkey due to the S-400 issue. Again, within this framework, we were subjected to unfair and unlawful practices such as removing Turkey from the F-35 program.\n\nThirdly, the fact that the US has not taken concrete steps regarding the FETO (Fetullah Terrorist Organization) structure in the US, which does not satisfy us, constitutes the main points of dispute in the relations between Turkey and the US. Our expectation, of course, is to implement a policy review process that takes into account Turkey's national interests. When the Biden administration came to power, after the Trump era, we contacted them at every level and expressed our concerns and demands on these issues, and we continue to do so. Finally, as you know, in the meeting of our president with Mr. Biden on the margins of the G20 Summit in Rome, these issues were discussed in detail. Not only these controversial issues, but also developments in the Caucasus, the process in Syria, Iraq, the fight against terrorism, the Eastern Mediterranean, and other issues, and developments in Ukraine were also discussed in detail.\n\nAs a result of that meeting, it was agreed to establish a mechanism that will deal with all issues in Turkey-US relations. Currently, our Foreign Ministry has sent a paper to the American side on how the structure of this mechanism will be, what issues will be addressed and how the process will work. Our work on this continues. Comprehensively, we want to conduct these relations based on mutual interest and respect, as an equal, fair, and transparent relationship, but while doing this, of course, Turkey's own national interests, priorities, and threat perception come first. In this context, our negotiations continue to advance these relations on the right ground and act with a positive agenda, and we will continue to work in this direction from now on.\n\nQ: There are meetings between the Turkish-US defense delegations, and a mechanism is being established between the foreign ministries, based on what you mentioned. Do you think it is possible to open a new page between Turkey and the US? What are your expectations for the next year in this regard?\n\nA: If certain conditions are met, if certain steps are taken, especially on the issues related to Turkey's threat perception and national security interests, a new page will be certainly opened. These relations can progress with a much more positive agenda, but of course, we can't proceed by ignoring or delaying the main issues. Despite this, we will continue to do our best to solve these problems with a positive agenda, from the defense industry to the fight against terrorism, from trade to regional issues to develop a relationship based on mutual interest and respect.\n\nIf Turkey has a role in Ukraine crisis, Turkey will take it\n\nQ: There are concerns in the capitals of Western countries that Russia may attempt a second invasion of Ukraine. What is Turkey's position on this issue, and what exactly is Turkey's path towards solving this crisis?\n\nA: First of all, we are following the tension between Russia and Ukraine with great concern. Our president has also constantly addressed this issue in his meetings with both Mr. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Mr. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky, as well as in meetings with other European leaders, the president of the US, and other regional leaders. Our advice to both parties is to lower this tension as soon as possible and take the necessary steps to prevent a military conflict in the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine. In this regard, our president told Zelensky and Putin that if Turkey or himself is expected to play a role in this issue, they can do their bid. Here, of course, reducing the tension is in everyone's interest.\n\nA new military conflict, Russia's entry into Ukrainian territory, some military movements in or on Ukraine, the mobilization of militia forces, or experiencing conflicts will not benefit anyone.\n\nIt will further increase tensions in the entire region. Thousands of Ukrainians have already lost their lives due to this tension, and we, of course, have good relations with Russia in principle, but at the same time, we have a clear stance on the protection of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Our advice to both parties is to stay away from such a conflict, reduce tensions, and to settle their issues through negotiations. If there is a role for Turkey in this direction, Turkey will certainly play it. Because Turkey has good relations with both countries at the same time. There are not many countries like Turkey today. In other words, some countries have relations with Ukraine, but their relations with Russia are not good, some are the opposite, but our president has very good relations with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.\n\nIn other words, if there is a role that Turkey can play in the implementation of smart diplomacy and an effective diplomatic process in this period, of course, our president will happily fulfill it. The international community also needs to be very careful. It is of great importance that they display an approach aimed at reducing tensions and resolving problematic issues between the two sides, rather than escalating statements or attitudes. Because, you know, the issue is not just between Russia and Ukraine. When you look at it from a larger perspective, the issue is reflected in Ukraine as a result of the tension between Russia and the Western alliance, Russia and NATO, Russia and America, and Europe. As we are in constant contact with the Western alliance, the US, Europe, and a part of that alliance and a NATO member country, we are in the process. Our advice to the Americans and Europeans is to take genuine, concrete, and convincing steps to reduce tensions If this is achieved, of course, an important ground for the solution of the issue will be formed, a new climate will be formed, and everyone should do their best to support this. This is our main advice to everyone.\n\nArmenian diaspora needs to act responsibly\n\nQ: Moscow will also host the process of normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. Can I get your assessment of the process of normalizing relations with Armenia?\n\nA: If you remember, when Turkey ended its diplomatic relations with Armenia and closed its border gate in 1992, the main issue was the (Armenian) occupation of Karabakh. Today, with the victory that came after the 44-day war last year, the Karabakh problem has been resolved. Karabakh has regained its original place as the Azerbaijani territory and the issue that caused us to end our relations with Armenia in 1992 has also disappeared. So, there is no reason not to normalize it anymore. From the very beginning, our president already had said Turkey would also take steps to normalize relations with Armenia in parallel with the process between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Therefore, as you know, special representatives were also appointed in this direction.\n\nI believe that the process will rapidly and constructively advance from now on. There is also a will on the Armenian side in this direction. Our will is already clear and specific on this matter. We do not have a biased approach towards Armenia. As our neighbor, of course, we want the border to be re-opened and diplomatic relations to restart. For this, certain conditions must be met and certain issues must be negotiated. The process, which will be carried out by special representatives, aims at exactly this.\n\nHere, I would like to underline the following: Armenia's normalization of relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey will contribute to the whole region and will also benefit Armenia more. Because Armenia is a small, poor, underpopulated, and landlocked country, with extremely limited trade routes. If Armenia signs a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, its relations with Azerbaijan will improve. If its relations are normalized with Turkey, different developments will occur in many areas from border trade to border security, to flights of Turkish Airlines, and all these will benefit Armenia and the people of Armenia. We also have very good relations with the Armenian citizens living in our country. God forbid, we have always taken a very clear stance in case of discrimination or an attack against them. We have relations with the Turkish Armenian community at all levels. They can reach us at any time when they have a problem.\n\nNormalization with Armenia will certainly enable Turkish Armenians to establish relations with Armenia more easily and bring relief in other areas, but the Armenian diaspora, which is concentrated in two countries of the world, including France and the US, must also act responsibly. Claiming that the 1915 events were \"genocide\" through certain obsessions and bringing it to the agenda as a precondition will no longer benefit anyone, especially after this point. Now a new page has been opened in the Caucasus, a new era has begun, and the diaspora communities should also see this truth, and they should adopt a manner and attitude that will be for the benefit of Armenia and the benefit of the region. If this happens, everyone will benefit from it. A new period of peace and stability begins in the Caucasus and all countries benefit from it.\n\nTurkey to continue to stand by Libyan people, legitimate government\n\nQ: As you know, the election process in Libya is stuck. The election has been postponed and there is political uncertainty in the country. What does Turkey offer to overcome this crisis, and can you talk about Ankara's contributions to the resolution of the crisis?\n\nA: We have supported the political process in Libya from the very beginning to the end, and we will continue to support it from now on. Elections were one of the steps and stages of this political process. We made the necessary suggestions for it to be held, but the Libyans decided to postpone the elections with an agreement among themselves since the conditions were not suitable there. There is an ongoing political negotiation process among the Libyans on how long the elections will be postponed, what will happen in the postponement process, who will manage this process and how will different issues from political party law to the constitution be settled in this period until the next elections. We are supporting this process and will continue to do so.\n\nIt is something that we have supported from the very beginning, that the eastern, western, and southern groups come together in Libya and that legitimate actors take part in a legitimate political process. In this process, you know, we signed an important agreement with Libya. These are the Maritime Boundary Treaty and the Military Cooperation and Training Agreement. These agreements still remain valid. Even if there are objections from some groups in Libya or some countries in the region, Libyans have a very clear and unequivocal stance on this issue. In other words, the legitimate Libyan government has no objection to these agreements, and they have the will to continue these agreements as they are. This is pleasing for us. Therefore, as Turkey, we will continue to stand by the Libyan people and the legitimate government, both in terms of security, supporting the political process, and rebuilding Libya, and strengthening its infrastructure. Hopefully, this new political process is announced to everyone with a new calendar and a transparent roadmap as soon as possible without causing any tension or conflict. We will continue to stand by the Libyans as a supportive and facilitating actor in the process led by the Libyans, whenever they will be held, and in whatever way, they will be planned.\n\n2021 was difficult year\n\nStressing that 2021 was a difficult year considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said: “This (pandemic) has had very different effects on people's social mobility, individual life, of course, on the global economy, national economies, and regional developments.”\n\n“There have been natural disasters. I hope 2022 will be the year where peace, prosperity, stability, and trust are rebuilt and spread for all of us, and a year all can benefit equally from blessings, wealth, peace, stability, and security. As Turkey, we will continue to play its role both in our own region and in global issues, under the leadership of our president. He has been saying for a long time, ‘The world is bigger than five.’ We saw once again how fragile the global system was, bigger than the world's five and all other countries combined. At the same time, our president also made a call that 'a fairer world is possible. He also wrote a book about it. This is not a technical call to reform the UN Security Council or the UN structure. He says that a world in which economic, political, and social justice dominates is possible, where the differences between the rich and the poor, the northern and the southern, the advantageous and the disadvantaged, the east and the west do not turn into the abyss, and where our differences are experienced as wealth.\n\nIn this direction, from the environmental crisis to climate change, to the fair sharing of economic resources, to ensuring security, peace, and stability, every country, from the biggest to the smallest, has a big role. I hope 2022 will be a year when awareness and consciousness rise, mind, conscience, emotion, humanity, mercy, and compassion prevail, and world politics are directed.\n\n*Writing by Gozde Bayar in Ankara.",

      "content": "As last week marked the first anniversary of the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the Caucasus, an Armenian expert is hopeful for the future of his country’s relations with both Azerbaijan and Turkey, which assisted Azerbaijan in its victory.\n\nThe outcome of the fall 2020 Karabakh conflict “altered the landscape, it's changed the map of the region,” Richard Giragosian, a US-born Armenian political analyst, told Anadolu Agency.\n\n“For Armenia-Turkey normalization, however, the key difference is a big advantage,” said Giragosian, now director of the Regional Studies Center based in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.\n\nAzerbaijan, Armenia’s neighbor and longtime rival, “is no longer opposed to normalization,” he added.\n\nClose allies with Azerbaijan under the slogan “One nation, two states,” by contrast Turkey has long been at loggerheads with Armenia, over such issues as Yerevan’s refusal to recognize their shared border, terror attacks on Turkish diplomats, and claims over the events of 1915.\n\nAnother reason for Turkey to pursue normalization with Armenia, Giragosian said, is that it offers “a way for Turkey to have a more active role in the regional restoration of trade and transport.”\n\nDue to its intransigence, landlocked Armenian has long been left out of transport and trade lines towards Turkey and Europe, routes meant to draw the region closer together.\n\nLiberation of Karabakh\n\nRelations between the former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been tense since 1991, when the Armenian military occupied Nagorno-Karabakh (Upper Karabakh), a territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan.\n\nAn Armenian offensive last September, including attacks on civilians, triggered a 44-day conflict which ended with a Russia-brokered agreement on Nov. 10, 2020.\n\nDuring the conflict, Azerbaijan liberated several cities and some 300 settlements that had been occupied by Armenia for almost 30 years.\n\nAt the end of the conflict, Turkish leaders voiced hope that peace could open doors to greater regional reconciliation and cooperation.\n\nGiragosian also pointed to out what he calls “a very positive exchange of messages” since the Karabakh conflict, not only by Nikol Pashinyan, the Armenian prime minister, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but also by Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev.\n\n“In other words, the stars are realigning in terms of a more positive environment conducive to two developments: the reopening of the closed border between Armenia and Turkey, and the establishment of diplomatic relations,” he added.\n\n“And in this post-war context, normalization in this second attempt is now much stronger and much more likely to succeed,” he explained.\n\nNormalization between Armenia, Turkey\n\nAccording to Giragosian, there was one winner from the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, “it wasn't Azerbaijan as much as Russia.”\n\n“Russia has now deployed military forces to all three countries in this region,” he added, including a joint Turkish-Russian center to monitor the peace in Karabakh.\n\n“Nevertheless, I do think that the Russian peacekeepers, (the) Russian buildup in southern Armenia has added a new challenge to the independence and sovereignty of Armenia and Azerbaijan, meaning that Turkey in many ways is seen as an important alternative to any kind of overdependence on Russia,” he said.\n\nOn the future of relations, Giragosian is optimistic. “I would say the outlook for normalization between Armenia and Turkey is no longer a question of if, but when. And in this context, I do expect it in the coming year.”\n\n“The reason is, this is a second round of reengagement, and the first time, the signing of the protocols, as delayed or disappointing as they were, because they weren't implemented,” he added, referring to the 2009 Zurich protocols between Turkey and Armenia, which proposed opening the border as well as mending diplomatic ties.\n\n“They actually achieved a tremendous amount in terms of the border (which) didn't reopen yet, but minds reopened.”\n\nNormalization “was never supposed to be that quick or that easy,” he explained.\n\nNow, in the wake of the Karabakh conflict, the prospects for normalization “are much more realistic,” he argued.\n\n“However, we're only talking about the basic minimum, neighbors with open borders and trade and diplomatic relations. This is not reconciliation,” he added.\n\n“This has nothing to do with the genocide issue,” he said, referring to the deaths of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915, which Turkey has accused Armenia of ignoring the historical record on in favor of using it as a politicized weapon against Turkey on the international stage.\n\n“This is about normalization,” said Giragosian. “And it's a process I fully support because it's the first step toward reconciliation.”\n\n&amp;lt;br class=\"k-br\" /&amp;gt;",

      "content": "A Turkish-French high school student was questioned by French intelligence officers about his Muslim identity and for alleged extremism after rejecting his teacher's claims about the events that occurred in 1915 in what is now Turkey.\n\nThe student, identified as Altay, faced intimidation, threats of jailtime, and attempts to associate him with extremism because he did not accept his teacher's assertions in history class on June 2, despite it not being a crime under French law to object to the Armenian claims.\n\nAltay and his family, who did not share their last name over concerns for their safety, recounted the events to Anadolu Agency, saying that his teacher had devoted half of the 2-hour class to the Armenian claims, continually saying that Turks \"killed Armenians\" and civilians.\n\n\"I couldn't stand it. I endured for 40 minutes and then calmly asked the question: 'Is there evidence?' Then, the teacher suddenly got angry and said: 'How can you say this? How can you object to this?'\" said Altay.\n\nHe added that his teacher said he could go to prison for a year for his words allegedly denying the \"so-called\" Armenian genocide, with the school administrators calling his father to discuss what happened.\n\nAfter doing some research, he found out that none of his comments constituted a crime in France and that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) did not oblige defining the 1915 events as a \"genocide.\"\n\nQuestions on alleged radicalism, Muslim identity\n\nAfter the incident, Altay was called a week later by intelligence forces to answer questions.\n\nHe said he was treated kindly, but that despite being told that he had not done anything illegal, they took the usernames and passwords of his social media accounts and asked questions about his religious beliefs and practices.\n\nAs a student undergoing exams at the time, Altay emphasized that he had been under a great deal of stress and, seriously worried about his future, was unable to concentrate on schoolwork.\n\nRestrictions on freedom of speech\n\nAltay's Father Aydin said that during his meeting with the principal of his son's school, he had been told that the teenager was \"facing a very bad incident,\" and that he could be fined or jailed.\n\nThe administrators \"exaggerated the incident\" during the conference, he said. In response, Aydin underlined that in France, \"people have freedom of speech\" and objected to them restricting his son's freedom of expression.\n\n\"If he committed such a major crime, why don't you give disciplinary punishment?\" Aydin said he told the principal, who said that was not possible.\n\n\"I said: 'But you convey everything to the high authorities, why don't you punish him? If he's guilty, then you need to punish him.' Then they were silent. They didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"Since that day, I've been in a little bit of depression. Since I was very worried, they gave me leave from work. My son's mental state also deteriorated. No one came to our support in this matter in France, only my colleagues at work supported me, nobody else...No one from the French administration called me.\"\n\nAltay's mother Aysel also expressed that she was seriously worried about her son's future after the incident.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- Turkey's then-prime minister -- expressed his condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.",

If a genocide is to be discussed, this discussion should be about the Muslims.\"\n\nUnderlining that it was Muslims who suffered genocide and violence during that period, he went on to say: \"However, with a reverse reading of history, the resistance of the Muslims, the position taken by the state here and the relocation process of the Armenians are seen as a 'genocide'.\"\n\nKoclar, along with his colleague Haluk Selvi of the northwestern Sakarya University, is scheduled on Thursday to hold a social media session in which they will discuss massacres committed by Armenian gangs during the events of 1915.\n\nAs discussions on the 1915 incidents diverged from the historical reality, they have turned into an incomprehensible chaos, said the historian, adding that he and Selvi would share the truth of these events with a wide audience through their live broadcast on social media and that they would keep telling these events on all platforms in order to reveal the truth.\n\nMass graves found in many parts of Van province and the Zeve Martyrs' Cemetery and memorial built in honor of 2,500 massacred Muslims in the Tusba district, are the greatest evidence of the massacres committed by the Armenian gangs, he added.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.\n\nA subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as “genocide,” describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia, as well as international experts, to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was the country’s prime minister at the time, expressed condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.\n\n*Writing by Seda Sevencan from Istanbul",

      "content": "An American lawyer criticized remarks of President Joe Biden calling 1915 events \"genocide,\" saying it was a political statement and had nothing to do with the law.\n\nAnadolu Agency interviewed Bruce Fein, a constitutional lawyer who was the associate deputy attorney general and general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission under former President Ronald Reagan's administration.\n\nBruce Fein said that among all the relevant powers in World War I, only Armenia has kept the archives secret, which he said leads to a natural inference: \"What are you hiding?\"\n\nHere is the interview:\n\nAnadolu Agency: President Biden made a statement on April 24 called the 1915 events during the Ottoman era as Armenian \"genocide\" for the first time. How do you read 1915 events? What is your insight on those events?\n\nBruce Fein: I think I would like to represent the audience that political statements don't have any endpoint to this issue because they have no legal stand. Both the European Court of Human Rights in 2015, in a case called Perincek versus Switzerland, and I remember the European Court -- one of its members is Armenia but not Turkey -- made clear and echoing an earlier decision by France's Constitutional Council that legislative and administrative bodies have no jurisdiction, they have no legal authority to pronounce guilt or innocence on the crime of genocide. That can only be done by a court of law. Under the Genocide Convention Article 9, if there's a dispute about whether events were genocide, they are to be adjudicated before the International Court of Justice in the Hague.\n\nThat article went into effect 70 years ago in 1951. Armenia has never ever taken their claim to the International Court of Justice as prescribed by the Genocide Convention. Obviously, Turkey, like any other person, enjoys a presumption of innocence and until there's a tribunal that decided one way or the other, the presumption of innocence prevails.\n\nNow, if I am to look at the events of 1915, with my knowledge of the Genocide Convention, it seems to me highly dubious (that) the killings -- which on both sides were very, very terrible -- constituted a genocide for several reasons.\n\nFirst, there is a principle of universal law that acts which were not criminal at the time they committed cannot retroactively be made criminal. The whole concept of genocide wasn't even coined till 1943, many, many decades after 1915.\n\nSo, to retroactively apply them to events of 1915 runs against the grain of international law. During the evolution of the Genocide Convention, it was understood that a killing, a death because of a political motivation, is not a genocide. Political standing was excluded by the clear vote when it came up for discussion by the participants drafting the Genocide Convention. That is, when you have killings in result, because there's a battle over secession, for instance.\n\nThose are not killings that can be characterized as genocide because they're over political disputes whether a particular group deserves independence or not. It's not all that different from the United States Civil War. When in 1861, Southern states wanted to secede, there was a very, very bloody Civil War, hundreds of thousands died. That killings were over a political view. One wanted independence, the union said, \"no, you have no authority under our Constitution.\" The killings were not genocide.\n\nAnd if you're looking at what transpired in World War I, even taking the Armenian Ottomans at their own words, it clearly was not genocide.\n\nThe Armenian Ottomans, they revolted in 1915. They were citizens of the Ottoman Empire. They owed them a duty of loyalty and were seeking to revolt in order to obtain political independence from the Ottoman Empire. They wanted to secede for a political objective.\n\nThe killings that ensued were not genocide by definition. The Ottoman Armenians themselves at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 boasted that they in 1915 joined the Entente powers as belligerence. Those were the words they used. This was by someone Mr. (Boghos) Nubar, who was a general in the Ottoman army before he committed treason.\n\nThey (Armenians) abandoned their loyalty to the Ottoman Empire through Russia and France, which were then enemies of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey, and fought as belligerents. They died as belligerents and those are not genocidal killings.\n\nMoreover, there's at least circumstantial evidence that substantiates that the killings were not genocide. They were not killings of innocent victims who were defenseless. Again, at the Paris Peace Conference, the Armenian Ottoman, at that time the Ottoman Empire crumbled, but the Armenian representatives stated quite clearly that Ottoman Turks died in the same proportion, millions as the Ottoman Armenians.\n\nCompare that, for example, with the Holocaust, Jews at these extermination camps. Six million died. Well, what about the Nazis, the perpetrators? Did they die in those proportionate numbers? They didn't die at all.\n\nAnd that's why a very, very renowned Princeton historian Bernard Lewis says it is preposterous to liken what happened to the Armenians in World War I to the Holocaust. That's a view also echoed by former Nobel Peace Prize winner and Prime Minister of Israel Shimon Peres.\n\nSo, when you look at all of the circumstances, the statistics. The Armenian Ottomans' own statements, I believe there's no plausible case to argue in favor of genocide characterization of the tragedy of World War I and I believe it's precisely for that reason that for 70 long years, Armenia has refused to take their accusation that Turkey is guilty of genocide to the International Court of Justice. As we speak today, that international court is open and Armenia could have its claim adjudicated. It doesn't want to because it fears it would lose.\n\nAnadolu Agency: There is a clear distinction. As you also mentioned, internal conflicts or some types of civil war and genocide, of course. Despite this fact, why do you think the Biden administration made a statement, calling it a genocide?\n\nBruce Fein: But remember this, politicians, they don't read history and ulterior political motives. Do you think that Joe Biden and his staff went and read through all of the staggering amounts of archives and historical writings about this era? Of course, not.\n\nThe reason why they make decisions is they have ulterior political motives. Money that gives them campaign contribution helps get the vote out. And unfortunately for Turkey, Armenian Americans are far better organized. They're far more wealthy than Turkish Americans. And so, all this is a political statement. It has nothing to do with the law whatsoever.\n\nAnd that's why you get these things and of course, they never end the controversy. You can't. Because, as the European Court of Human Rights is held in the French Constitutional Council, legislative, executive bodies have no jurisdiction that adjudicates an allegation of a crime of genocide. So all it does is fester politically forever. And that's why Armenia keeps it in the political domain forever. They don't want it adjudicated. They fear they would lose. Politically, they're far more armed than Turkish Americans in the political arena, and they've won. So why risk a loss in an actual court of law?\n\nI'd like to point out also that the International Court of Justice has decided on previous genocide accusations. There was an accusation brought by Croatia against Serbia in 2015, accusations brought by Bosnia Herzegovina against Serbia, Montenegro, 2007. So it's not as though genocide allegations can't be litigated, they can and they have been litigated in the International Court of Justice and made judgments on this score. Why do the Armenians resist? Again I come back, they think they would lose.\n\n'Only Armenia has refused to open their archives'\n\nAnother reason that makes their case suspect is that of all the relevant powers in World War I, only Armenia has refused to open their archives. Turkey has opened its, France has done its, Germany, Russia, Great Britain, United States … Only Armenia has kept them secret. And that leads to a natural inference. What are you hiding? Why, if you believe you have such an overwhelming case, wouldn't you open your archives to everyone and expect, why must be all sorts of incriminating evidence against Turkey. But no, they still remain closed.\n\nAnadolu Agency: The US is based on promoting democracy, human rights and touts universal values. But despite this fact, the United States goes ahead with a certain judgment based on a domestic political agenda. Is it fair that the United States president [Biden] goes ahead against all these values and leans toward a domestic political issue?\n\nBruce Fein: Well, I certainly think it's unfair and unjust and not in accord with American values. But, unfortunately, it's not simply Turkey here that [was] singled out. It's unfortunate that we have lost such respect.\n\nIn many ways, for the law, that we make pronouncements, again, before it's out of trial. Oh, there's genocide in Burma, there's genocide in China, there's genocide in Darfur, whatever. I mean, I'm not trying to defend genocide. It's a terrible crime. But there's a presumption of innocence, that's of universal standing, that's existed for 4,000 years. If there's a problem, then you need to take it to a court, and the International Court of Justice is long-standing. It's there available, it has shown itself and the cases are revolving around that terrible wars after the breakup of Yugoslavia capable of rendering decisions. It's very quite reckless and stigmatizing to throw around this charge of genocide, make it seem as though you're issuing a conclusion. And you don't even have a trial.\n\nAnd I also would say that what President Biden said is not universally shared throughout all the United States, to be candid, most Americans really don't know what the issue is about whatsoever. We don't teach history very much in the United States.\n\nIf we don't get an International Court of Justice ruling, this is going to fester politically, forever, or it could be another 50 years. And of course, even statements by the president, they're not binding. I mean, if the future president comes and says, \"No, I don't believe what President Biden said and I believe something different,\" then you go back the other way. Same with resolutions in Congress, one doesn't bind the next one, and they're not court judgments. So it is easy to reverse them.\n\n[Biden's decision] may have an impact on Turkish American relations. That's surely true. I also believe the fallout emboldens Armenian Americans to be more vicious, more bullying, more intimidating, more threatening to Turkish Americans, saying, well, even though the President knows that you know you deny genocide makes you complicit in the crime, you're really hateful people and all those sorts of things, and the fallout is very devastating.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Erdogan -- Turkey's then-prime minister -- expressed his condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.\n\n* Servet Gunerigok contributed the story.",

Those who are calling it a genocide, show us the graves?\" he asked.\n\n\"We are not accepting any pressure from the West and the US for our internal and external policies, and we will not even if they continue to do that in future (as well).\"\n\nMunir Ahmed, the director of Development Communications Network, said Turkey is being considered a threat to the vested regional interests of the US and EU.",

      "content": "The writer works at the Baku-based think-tank Center of Analysis of International Relations (AIR). He is the head of a department that focuses on Azerbaijani foreign policy, geopolitics in the South Caucasus, the internal and external policy of Turkey, Azerbaijan-Turkey relations.\n\nThe use of the term “genocide” by US President Joe Biden to describe the events of 1915 has sparked a slew of legal and political debates. Legal experts believe that this is a political statement and has nothing to do with international law, while political experts believe the statement is not even in favor of the regional politics of the US, much less Turkey-US relations and the situation of Turkish citizens of Armenian descent. On the contrary, the declaration risks seriously damaging the post-conflict peacebuilding process in the South Caucasus.\n\nAccording to the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, international courts, not political leaders or parliaments, have the authority to determine whether or not the term genocide can be applied to a situation. In this regard, there is as yet no court decision labeling the 1915 events as a “genocide”. In this case, however, the courts have reached the exact opposite conclusion. According to a 2013 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), for example, the events of 1915 are a matter for courts of law to authoritatively speak on, not politicians.\n\nAlthough there are disagreements about its legal implications, this statement will undoubtedly have political repercussions. This declaration will almost certainly have negative consequences, especially in terms of cooperation opportunities in the South Caucasus region following the Second Karabakh War. Biden’s declaration has been particularly described as a show of support for Armenian revanchists, who suffered a heavy defeat in the Second Karabakh War, and as a damaging step toward regional cooperation. President Biden reportedly told President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the phone the day before the announcement that this had been his position for the past twenty years and that he must keep his word. This, however, appears to be a simplistic explanation that does not ring true. For example, before 2008 US presidential elections, Barack Obama had also promised to the Armenian diaspora and lobby organizations that he would define the events of 1915 as \"genocide.\" But he never uttered that word during his time in the office in order to avoid damaging US-Turkey relations.\n\nBiden’s statement came at a time when Azerbaijan and Turkey were making statements about post-war cooperation in the region, causing deep disappointment in the region. Azerbaijani Presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev called President Biden’s declaration a “historical mistake”. During a recent telephone conversation with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev expressed strong support for his country’s strategic ally by stating that Turkey had been playing a critical and positive role in the region in the post-conflict period and that the US president’s statement was met with concern by both Azerbaijan’s leadership and public.\n\nFollowing the Second Karabakh War, Azerbaijan made three concrete offers in the region: the opening of railway communication lines between Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, and Turkey, the emergence of a six-party cooperation format in the region, and the integration of Armenians living in Karabakh into Azerbaijan. The goal, according to President Ilham Aliyev, was to reduce regional tensions and prevent future wars.\n\nRecently, there has been some support in Armenia, albeit at a low level, in response to Azerbaijan’s and Turkey’s proposals for regional cooperation. Some Armenian politicians, including Pashinyan, recognize that without regional cooperation, Armenia's future is in danger. Pashinyan’s statement that Armenia should review its relations with its neighbors is remarkable. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian also acknowledged this reality during a visit to Georgia, stating that Armenia should improve relations with Georgia and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe resolution of the Karabakh issue has also created new opportunities for Turkey and Armenia to establish diplomatic relations and open the border between them. Statements by both countries’ authorities indicate that they are willing to go in that direction. One of the main issues between the parties, in this case, is one of trust. Mutual trust must be established in addition to diplomatic relations between the two sides in order to achieve normalization of relations between the peoples of both sides. Biden’s statement, on the other hand, undermines trust between the two peoples and jeopardizes the normalization of relations. “The tension caused by the use of the issue in parliamentary agendas for decades has not served the rapprochement of the two nations; on the contrary, it provokes hostile feelings and delays peace,” said Sahak Mashalian, head of Turkey’s Armenian Patriarchate.\n\nAs a result of Biden’s statement, there’s a possibility that the demand for the “genocide” to be recognized will resurface on the bilateral agenda. Turkey has a clear proposal in this regard: establish a joint commission to investigate the events of 1915. Armenia, however, rejects this proposal and opposes an objective examination of the events. Therefore, Biden’s statement undermines the possible reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia.\n\nFurthermore, there are also revanchist and radical nationalist opposition groups competing against Pashinyan ahead of the June snap parliamentary elections announced after Pashinyan’s resignation. Although these groups have been trying for a long time to gain support in Armenia, they have remained weak against Pashinyan. Because of Biden’s statement, however, these radical groups in Armenia now have the chance to become more active and increase the number of their supporters. Therefore, Biden’s statement negatively affects regional cooperation opportunities as well as Armenia’s pre-election process, playing into the hands of radical nationalist groups.\n\nBiden's statement does not appear to be in the best interests of Turkish Armenians, either. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s condolence messages to Turkish Armenians have served to build a climate of trust in Turkey for the past 18 years. Therefore, Armenians living in Turkey are expressing their discomfort with Biden’s statement. They believe that third parties are exploiting the Armenian issue for political gain. “The US and the EU are involved in the issue with political motives,” Bedros Sirinoglu, the head of the Armenian Foundations Union in Istanbul, said last Friday, criticizing political authorities for instrumentalizing the 1915 incidents, which happened between the Turkish and Armenian nations. He stated that “the prerequisite for empathy with the Armenian people should not be to play with the dignity of the Turkish people or adopting a hostile attitude towards Turkey.”\n\nAs we have seen, Biden’s statement pleased neither Turkey nor Azerbaijan, nor all Armenians, but rather some radical nationalist elements in the diaspora and in Armenia. This declaration jeopardizes regional peace while confining Armenia’s future to events that occurred over a century ago. Instead of making such provocative statements, the Biden administration should seek ways to support the region’s post-conflict peacebuilding and cooperation process. This would help to increase the chances of a lasting peace between Turkey and Armenia, as well as between Azerbaijan and Armenia peace, by following through on the November 10 declaration.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency.",

      "content": "The Zeve martyrs' cemetery and memorial built in honor of 2,500 Muslims massacred during World War I in present-day eastern Turkey, reveals the extent of the atrocities committed by Armenian gangs, according to a Turkish scholar.\n\n\"The Zeve Memorial is home to very painful stories. Incidents that go against human dignity took place here,\" historian Bekir Koclar told Anadolu Agency in the eastern province of Van, where Zeve is found today.\n\n\"The Muslim community of seven villages of the city fled to the village of Zeve. Subject to the attacks of the Armenian gangs, 2,500 Muslim women, elderly and children were massacred here,\" recounted Koclar, who took part in the 1990s in an excavation near the area that unearthed a mass grave.\n\n\"We witnessed very gruesome things when the soil was dug,\" he said, adding that the remains suggested that the victims had been tortured to death and that the belongings of women and children, as well as Qurans -- Muslim holy books -- had been unearthed at the site as well.\n\nNoting that the massacre was now on the record through the photographs taken at the excavation,\" Koclar, who heads the History Department at Van Yuzuncu Yil University, underlined that the region's Muslim community suffered greatly at the hands of the Armenian gangs and that this constituted genocide.\n\nAbdulaziz Kardas, a faculty member at the same department, explained that the Armenian gangs in the region occupied Van city on May 20, 1915, with the help of Russian troops.\n\n\"They weren't satisfied with just occupying Van. The villages between Van and Ercis had begun to be occupied,\" said Kardas, referring to the seven villages whose Muslim populations were forced to flee to Zeve.\n\n\"The area upon which we stand holds the status of a testament to history. The Zeve Memorial is clear evidence that the Armenian gangs committed genocide,\" added the historian.\n\nThese events occurred in the runup to the events of 1915, when Turkey says Armenian deaths in eastern Anatolia resulted took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nOn Saturday, US President Joe Biden released a statement characterizing the events of 1915 as a \"genocide, which Turkey objects to, instead describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a history commission to examine the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- Turkey's then prime minister and now president -- expressed his condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in 1915.\n\nBiden's statement is 'criminal'\n\nOn the events of 1915, Koclar said that they have ceased to be a scientific historical issue and that they had become politicized.\n\nStressing that Biden's use of the word \"genocide\" for the 1915 events had no scientific basis, Koclar said: \"When Western states have problems with Turkey, they raise this issue ... Turkey has repeatedly said that historians should discuss the events of 1915 among themselves.\"\n\n\"Our archives are open. Turkey maintains its offer both to Armenia and the countries making these claims: 'Let's set up a platform of historians, let's open all archives, let's discuss this issue.'\n\n\"This issue was already tried in the past and the trial concluded that genocide was not committed [against Armenians]. Describing the events of 1915 as 'genocide' despite this is evidence of racism against Muslims and Turks. In a legal sense, this is a crime. Biden has committed a crime,\" Koclar asserted.\n\nEchoing these sentiments, Kardas said that decisions by the parliaments of countries that the events of 1915 amounted to \"genocide\" did not agree with historical fact.\n\n\"Our archives are open to all. Any researcher who wants to can come and do research. Excavations were conducted here on April 4, 1990. Mass graves were opened in front of the eyes of the Western press and scientists,\" he said.\n\n\"The mass slaughters that the Armenians committed were set forth clearly.\"\n\nKardas also asserted that the US president's statement on April 24 had no historical or legal basis. He said that by releasing it, Biden \"also denies US documents.\"\n\n\"In 1918, two Americans came to Van, liberated from occupation, on horseback and conducted investigations. In their work, they report that Armenian gangs destroyed 95% of the houses of Muslims and massacred 62% of the population of Van,\" he stressed,\n\nHe accused Biden of releasing the statement on account of other existing problems in Turkish-US relations.\n\n*Writing by Merve Berker in Ankara",

      "content": "The author is a faculty member at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University, Department of Caucasus Studies\n\nA new era has begun in Turkey-US relations since President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20. It is known that the two sides have their differences on many issues, such as the exclusion of Turkey from the F-35 project between the two countries, the US' Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) sanctions, the S-400 issue, joint military exercises by the US and Greece, the events in Karabakh, the defense agreement between Israel and Greece, authorization in the US of arms sales to the Greek Cypriot administration, US support to terrorist organizations in Syria, the issue of Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO), and developments in northern Iraq and Libya.\n\nThough it was not anticipated that Biden would make such a historic mistake, the fact that he had especially not contacted Turkey, a strategic NATO ally, for a long time after taking office was already an indication that frigid winds were blowing between the sides. After Biden's April 24 message was published, US Ambassador to Ankara David Satterfield was summoned to Turkey's Foreign Ministry, and Turkey voiced its justified response. The Foreign Ministry also issued a statement that Turkey would not accept and condemned the expressions in Biden's statement which described the 1915 incidents as a \"genocide.\"\n\nWhat led to April 24 decision?\n\nMultiple factors played a role in Biden becoming the first US president since Ronal Reagan in 1981 to call the 1915 events a genocide. Yet the most significant factor here was that with this statement, the incidents of 1915 were sacrificed to domestic and foreign political interests, taking a road of no return. The US' April 24 decision will have a severe impact on Turkey-US and Turkish-Armenian relations in the coming days. So, what changed in the US that the incidents marked each year as \"Meds Yeghern\" (Great Calamity) were described as \"genocide\" on April 24, 2021?\n\nMotions recognizing the events of 1915 as genocide were already passed in Congress and its upper wing, the Senate, as well as in 49 of the 50 US states. However, that Biden made pledges to the Armenian diaspora during his election campaign also had a great impact on these decisions in the context of domestic politics. While the US press presented this step as an indication of the importance Biden attaches to human rights issues, it is obvious that in essence, domestic political interests had an important influence on this statement. From this point of view, such a decision by the US against Turkey, a NATO ally, caused the already-poor relations to suffer irreparable damage. Another case of delirium was the US press saying that relations with Turkey were being tested.\n\nAnother important factor in the decision was the developments that took place during the war in Karabakh. As is known, the US, despite being on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, had taken no initiative for the resolution of the Karabakh issue for 30 years and no progress had been made toward a solution. The US also did not involve itself much in the course of the Karabakh War, which was met with discomfort by the Armenian diaspora. Though the US claimed that it adopted a policy of neutrality under the pretext of its presidential election process, it was observed that it was actually left out due to Russia's policies. Hence, it can be stated that the US, which could not provide Armenia the support it sought during the war, paid its \"blood money\" to Armenia through this statement.\n\nWhat do expressions in letter mean?\n\nIt would be beneficial to take a look at the meaning of the expressions that Biden used in his letter. Though the explicit emphasis on the \"Ottoman\" state is portrayed to exempt the Republic of Turkey, the denotation that they \"recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring,\" lays a contradictory attitude.\n\nFurthermore, although some groups have interpreted the reference to \"Constantinople\" and the date of 1915 as an indication that Turkey's sensitivities are being observed, this has nothing to do with reality. What matters in this letter is that the word genocide was used. Also, let us not forget that much of the staff that took charge in the establishment of the Republic of Turkey consisted of Turkish intellectuals active in the late periods of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHow to interpret Turkish Armenian's viewpoints?\n\nMashalian's remarks in his statement that \"the tensions created by this issue being carried to the agendas of parliaments for decades does not serve to bring the two peoples closer.

      "content": "Turkey's Justice Ministry responded Monday to claims regarding the events of 1915 with an infographic containing lies and facts in legal terms on the issue.\n\nOn Saturday, US President Joe Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking with a long-held tradition of American presidents refraining from using the term.\n\nAnswering a series of questions, the infographic started with the definition of genocide, stating that it is a type of crime against the international community, the definition and framework of which is set by law.\n\nIt recalled that the crime was first defined at the international level by the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nStressing that Turkey has been a party to the convention since 1950, it said countries also regulated the crime of genocide in their domestic laws per the convention, to which 149 states are parties.\n\nOn the crime in Turkey's legislation, the infographic read: \"The Turkish Penal Code numbered 5237, which entered into force on June 1, 2005, regulates the crime of genocide in Article 76 and crimes against humanity in Article 77 by the framework set forth in international documents.\"\n\nIt said the statute of limitations would not be applied in those crimes committed after June 1, 2005.\n\nThe crime must be committed with a specific intention, it said, defining provisions of the crime, and added that there must be an act of partially or entirely destroying a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group just because of their nature.\n\n\"With this motive, acts of destruction such as killing and injuring, directed towards a certain group cause genocide crime,\" it said.\n\nAnswering the question of who decides an act to be genocide, it said undoubtedly, genocide is of interest to various disciplines such as politics, sociology and history.\n\n\"However, for an act to constitute a crime of genocide legally, either the jurisdiction of the country where the alleged acts took place or an international judicial mechanism (international criminal courts or International Court of Justice) with jurisdiction must decide on the issue,\" it said, referring to Article 6 of the 1948 UN Convention.\n\nThe accused must be alive for a prosecution to be initiated, it added.\n\nGenocide crimes in world history\n\nAnswering the question of whether there are judicial decisions concluded as genocide in world history, it said in 1945, the Nuremberg Court tried Germany's war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIt recalled that the court, which technically did not handle genocide, was established with an international status.\n\n\"Since 1954, Germany has started to prosecute the perpetrators of the Holocaust with the laws it has enacted,\" the ministry said, adding that the country lifted the statute of limitations in 1965, paving the way for the application of laws to past events.\n\n\"At the international level, the International Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia was established in 1993 and the Rwanda International Criminal Court in 1994, and crimes against humanity were tried and genocide was determined,\" it recalled.\n\nThe 1998 Rwanda verdict is the first judgment of genocide by an international court in world history, it said, adding that in 2007, the International Court of Justice acknowledged that there was a genocide in Bosnia.\n\n\"Therefore, there is a legal basis for calling the events in Germany, Bosnia and Rwanda a 'genocide',\" it stressed.\n\nOn the question of whether there is an authorized court decision describing the events of 1915 as \"genocide,\" it said there is no judicial decision on this matter and it is not possible principally and formally.\n\n\"It is out of the question for a judicial mechanism to take action against the framework laid down in the UN Convention and the decisions of the International Court of Justice,\" it emphasized.\n\nCan European Court of Human Rights judge 1915 events?\n\nIn its Perincek v. Switzerland and Mercan and others v. Switzerland judgments, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) stated that it does not have the authority to make binding decisions contrary to the International Criminal Court or the International Court of Justice in the context of the Genocide Convention regarding the events experienced by the Armenians during the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and whether the deportation could be deemed 'genocide' in international law.\n\n\"Therefore, any claims based on the 1915 events cannot be put forward before the ECHR,\" the ministry said.\n\nAnswering the question of whether not recognizing the events of 1915 as genocide can be punished, it referred to the above-mentioned ECHR trials and said: \"In these cases, the Swiss law, which considers it a crime to deny the Armenian genocide allegations, received a violation decision from the ECHR.\"\n\nThe issue has been evaluated within the scope of freedom of expression, it said.\n\nOn the question, if there is any legal basis to US President Biden's remarks, it said: \"Considering the Genocide Convention, to which our country is also a party, and the ICJ jurisprudence interpreting this agreement, the US president's statements have no legal basis.\"\n\nIt highlighted that the states also have a right not to be tainted, just like individuals.\n\n\"The unfounded claims put forward totally with political motives do not mean anything other than the quest to denigrate the glorious history of a nation that has lived with justice and law for centuries.\"\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan – Turkey's then-prime minister and now president – expressed his condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.",

      "content": "Turkey’s president on Monday denounced US President Joe Biden's \"unfounded\" statement on the events of 1915, saying it is \"contrary to the facts.\"\n\nAddressing a news conference following a three-hour Cabinet meeting in the capital Ankara, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said \"US President Biden made a statement that is unfounded, unjust and contrary to the facts about the painful events that took place more than a century ago.\"\n\nExpressing his and the Turkish nation's \"immense\" distress over Biden's statement, Erdogan once more stated that the US president's remarks \"have no historical and legal basis.\"\n\n\"As Turkey, we believe that it is inhumane to contest the sufferings of history,\" Erdogan said, reminding that Turkey is the only nation and state that is without rebuke and has a clear and satisfied conscience about its history.\n\n\"If you call it genocide, you should look in the mirror and evaluate yourselves,\" said Erdogan.\n\n\"Investigating historical events and revealing the truth should be left to experts and historians, not to politicians.\"\n\nGiving a detailed historical background to the Armenian issue, Erdogan said that until the World War I, the Armenian gangs caused about 40 riots, which got out of control and turned into massacres.\n\nThe Turkish leader also said that millions of Turkish and Kurdish civilian population from the eastern Van to northeastern Kars provinces and from the eastern Erzurum province to the central Anatolian region were massacred by the Armenian gangs.\n\n\"There are mass graves of Turks massacred by Armenians in many places, but nowhere can you find mass graves belonging to Armenians,\" he said.\n\nErdogan went on saying that prior to the World War I, the records show that a total of 1.3 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\"There are over 1 million documents in our archives now. Come in and examine the documents,\" he added.\n\nOn a proposed joint history commission on Armenian claims, Erdogan said Turkey is yet to receive a response to its offer.\n\n\"We have assured researchers of the commission of access to our archives, but other parties have not responded,\" he added.\n\nErdogan underscored that there is \"no concrete evidence regarding Armenian allegations nor any international court decision.\"\n\nGiving a detailed historical background to the Armenian issue, Erdogan said that until World War I, Armenian gangs caused about 40 riots which got out of control and turned into massacres.\n\nThe Turkish leader also said that millions of Turkish and Kurdish civilians from eastern Van province to northeastern Kars province and from eastern Erzurum province to the central Anatolian region were massacred by the Armenian gangs.\n\n'No human tragedy happened on April 24'\n\n\"There are mass graves of Turks massacred by Armenians in many places, but nowhere can you find mass graves belonging to Armenians,\" he said.\n\nErdogan went on saying that prior to World War I, records show that a total of 1.3 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\"There are over 1 million documents in our archives now. Come in and examine the documents,\" he added.\n\nRegarding the April 24, 1915 incidents claimed by Armenians, Erdogan said: \"Nothing happened on April 24 in terms of human tragedy.\"\n\n\"April 24, 1915 is only the day when the Ottoman Empire shut down [Armenian] organizations such as Dashnak, Hinchak and Ramgavar, which were engaged in activities with countries that were at war with the empire, and arrested 235 administrators of them,\" he said.\n\nNoting the relocation and resettlement law was still not introduced on that date, Erdogan said no such casualties from the Armenian side occurred.\n\n\"The Armenian community in our country recognized this date as a day of remembrance of their own suffering, in line with the general practice in the world,\" he said.\n\nDespite knowing the truth on the events regarding the mentioned date, Erdogan reminded that Turkey still sends a message to those Armenian communities, sharing their pain.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire did not send the Armenian population elsewhere, it relocated them within its territory, he said.\n\n\"Individuals subject to this law were given a week to prepare, and those who had an excuse were exempted from relocation. Necessary administrative measures were taken during the referral process, and adequate funds were provided to local units in this regard,\" Erdogan added.\n\n\"Following the arrests made by the Ottoman state on April 24, the relocation and resettlement law was enacted on May 27, and it was put into effect on June 1. The move [by Ottomans] was not taken due to a possible threat or danger, but [it was] rather a measure taken against an actual ongoing rebellion and increasing massacres [by Armenian gangs],\" he said.\n\nThe Turkish president further recalled that the mentioned dates also coincide with the Ottoman Empire's historical struggle on many fronts, especially in Canakkale.\n\n\"Due to full mobilization, almost all of the men were at the battlefield, and those vulnerable women, children and the elderly were left behind. Armenian gangs not only clashed with the Turkish army or the armed Turkish guards protecting their districts but also massacred innocent and defenseless people,\" he added.\n\nSaying that the Armenian gangs massacred defenseless civilian Turks and Kurds in Anatolia and the Circassians on the Caucasus side, Erdogan said: \"Armenian gangs boasted about the massacres they committed and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to migrate.\"\n\n\"Many documents related to this are available in the archives of the countries of the region,\" he added.\n\nHe further stressed that \"with the relocation and resettlement law, the Ottoman Empire decided to temporarily send the Armenian population, on which the gangs who committed these massacres were based, to other regions. Moreover, this decision did not cover all Armenians in the country, but only the Armenian population in places where gang attacks were intense.\"\n\nOn the number of losses during the relocation and resettlement process, the Turkish president said that according to records, only 150,000 people lost their lives either due to virus outbreaks, public order problems or fighting with security forces.\n\n- 'If you call it genocide, you should look in the mirror and evaluate yourselves'\n\n“Of course, each of these 150,000 people are a soul and are important,” he said, adding that “Armenian historians and politicians themselves admit that the actual numbers are exaggerated with an additional zero.”\n\n“Again, Armenian historians state that most of the losses were experienced during the wars at the front,” Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey’s president continued on, saying that the current Armenian population in Istanbul alone is 100,000.\n\n“This number [of the Armenian population] at one time reached 650,000 with those returning after the war. I guess people would not voluntarily return to a place where they experienced a massacre, genocide, Mr. Biden,” Erdogan said.\n\nOn Armenia’s 30-year-long occupation of Upper Karabakh, Erdogan called on Biden and reminded him of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk trio, namely the US, France and Russia.\n\n“You did not rescue the people there from this occupation for 30 years, and unfortunately, more than 1 million Azerbaijani brothers and sisters had to migrate from there. All of Karabakh was destroyed and burnt down. If you call it genocide, you should look in the mirror and evaluate yourselves,\" he said.\n\nSaying there are many occurrences that can be identified as genocide in US and European history, Erdogan said: “From Native Americans to Black people, from incidents in Germany’s Dresden city to [the nuclear] bombs dropped on Japan, from Vietnam to Iraq, these subjects can be opened to discussion.”\n\nErdogan continued by saying that the US and Europe take sides with the slander and lies of those who avoid supporting their arguments with archives\n\nHe said the US and Europe not only displayed hostility towards Turkey with such an attitude but also betrayed science.\n\nStressing that Turkey did not and will never forget the attacks by Armenian terrorist groups such as ASALA in the 1970s against Turkish diplomats, Erdogan said Turkey is aware of how the murders of the Turkish diplomats are protected and how the culprits were released from prisons.\n\nHe emphasized that Turkey also realizes that similar ambitions of Armenian terrorists are trying to be implemented through the PKK terrorist organization.\n\n“Allegations such as genocide are too sensitive to be the subject of politics. Leaving aside the science of history, the presidents and parliaments of the countries making judgments on such matters will only make things complicated,” Erdogan said.\n\nOn Turkey-US relations, President Erdogan said that relations between the two countries have closely been based on an understanding of a “trustful ally.”\n\nHe said relations between the two long-standing allies have been harmed due to the US’ supportive position on the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) and the PKK/YPG as well as the embargo implemented as a result of an issue over Turkey’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system which emerged initially due to the US.\n\n“Turkish-American relations have fallen far behind this level with the announcement of April 24,” he added.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking with the long-held tradition of American presidents of refraining from using the term.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these events as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan – Turkey's then prime minister and now president – expressed his condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.",

      "content": "Turkish forces have neutralized 31 PKK terrorists so far in northern Iraq as part of Turkey's new anti-terror operations there, the country's defense minister said Sunday.\n\nHulusi Akar was commenting after he and Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) commanders inspected the 3rd Infantry Division Command in Yuksekova district of Turkey’s southeastern Hakkari province and received a briefing on the newly launched Operations Pence-Simsek and Pence-Yildirim.\n\n\"So far, a total of 1,132 terror targets have been hit with our land fire support vehicles. Our Air Force also achieved great success as a whole, hitting 120 targets in total. Along with these, we evaluate that the terrorists have suffered great casualties,\" he said.\n\nNoting that so far, a total of 31 terrorists have been neutralized as part of the current operations in the regions, Akar said that six soldiers had been wounded.\n\nTurkey's Defense Ministry later announced that one soldier was martyred in the Operations Pence-Simsek area.\n\n\"Our fight is against all terrorists, especially the PKK. The world should know that we do not have any problems with any ethnic group, sect or religious group and that we are not targeting them,\" he noted.\n\nUnderlining that Turkey only targets terrorists, he also stressed that they will continue launching anti-terror operations until the last terrorist is neutralized.\n\nTurkey on Friday launched Operations Pence-Simsek and Pence-Yildirim in northern Iraq’s Metina and Avasin-Basyan regions near Turkey’s borders, Akar announced early Saturday.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said later Saturday that the operation aims to completely eliminate the terrorist threat along Turkey’s southern borders.\n\nTurkish authorities often use the word “neutralized” in statements to imply the terrorists in question surrendered or were killed or captured.\n\nThe PKK terrorist group often uses bases in northern Iraq, just across Turkey’s southern border, to hide and plot terrorist attacks in Turkey.\n\nIn its more than 35-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US and the European Union – has been responsible for the deaths of at least 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.\n\n'Biden's remarks deny their own documents'\n\nTouching on US President Joe Biden's remarks on the events of 1915, Akar noted that the statement is a distortion of historical facts and does not reflect the truth.\n\nHe emphasized that the allegations are extremely unfounded, groundless and have no basis.\n\n\"Everyone should know that this work belongs only to scientists, historians, that they [the claims] are not a matter of political decisions…Our position on this issue is very clear,\" Akar said.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking with American presidents' long-held tradition of refraining from using the term.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

      "content": "Allegations that 1.5 million Armenians died in a World War I relocation are untrue and do not fit the facts, according to a Turkish researcher on the subject, rebuffing the “genocide” claims.\n\n&lt;br class=\"k-br\" /&gt;\n\nStressing that it was not possible for Turks to kill 1.5 million Armenians in seven months in 1915, author/researcher Mehmet Arif Demirer said: “During World War II, Hitler killed 3 million Jews by establishing six human death camps over the course of four-and-a-half years.”\n\n“With what weapons and ammunition could we have killed 1.5 million Armenians in seven months?” he asked, underlining that at that time of the relocation there were no soldiers in the region, due to battles in Canakkale, on the other side of modern-day Turkey.\n\nHe went on to say that there are five documents regarding Armenians who were alive in 1921, including two in US State Department archives, two that are publications of an Armenian-American professor, and one that is a report of the League of Nations.\n\nBy looking at these, we can confirm the survival of 1.586 million Armenians, Demirer said.\n\nAs many as 486,000 Armenians arrived safely in Syria under the Dispatch and Settlement Law, he said. They started getting help from the American Relief Committee, and the American consul general in Syria wrote a letter to the ambassador in Istanbul on Feb. 8, 1916, he added.\n\nAt least 400,000 fled to Russia and sought permission to come back, he said, adding that there were 300,000 Armenians not subject to the Dispatch and Settlement Law and 200,000 Armenians who were Islamized.\n\n“In March 1918, 200,000 Armenians demanded autonomy in Eastern Anatolia. They have certificates. 1.586 million Armenians did not die,” Demirer said.\n\nRussian weapons, supplies left to Armenians\n\nTaking advantage of the fact that almost all of the Turkish army was at war in the west, in Canakkale, the Russian Army entered Van – in present-day eastern Turkey – on May 18, 1915 and took over all of eastern Anatolia, he said.\n\nAfter the 1917 Russian Revolution, Russian soldiers left behind their weapons and supplies in the lands they occupied, after being told that \"the new communist regime would distribute land to everyone,” Demirer added.\n\nThese weapons and supplies were left to the Armenians, according to Armenian author Arthur Derounian, who gave this information in a book, he said.\n\nDemirer stressed that there were enough Armenians in eastern Anatolia to take over the occupation from the Russians.\n\nArmenian demands for autonomy in eastern Anatolia and permission for the return of 400,000 Armenians who fled to Russia were not accepted at peace negotiations held in Trabzon, Turkey in 1918 between Ottoman, Georgian, and Armenian delegations, he said.\n\nCiting the 1920 Treaty of Alexandropol (Gyumri Agreement), which laid out a map similar to the border of modern-day Armenia, he said that four months after the pact was signed in December 1920, Armenia was occupied by Bolshevik Russians.\n\n‘Genocide claims are fever swamp’\n\n“On March 18, 1921, Armenia’s prime minister wrote a letter to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, (founder of Republic of Turkey and then-) Turkish parliament speaker, saying, 'Send me soldiers, weapons and ammunition',” Demirer related.\n\n“The (Armenian) Dashnaks – who had decided to betray the Turks seven years earlier, colluded with the enemy, and caused the occupation of eastern Anatolia – then seven years later asked the Turks for help against the Russians.”\n\nCalling the genocide allegations a fever swamp, Demirer said today nearly 2 billion out of the world’s approximately 8 billion people live in predominantly Christian counties.\n\n\"We have been unable explain to Christian countries the invalidity of the Christian Armenians’ genocide claims against Muslim Turks. Because of this, 31 countries and the Vatican took decisions against us,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that Turkey needs to refute the genocide claims by preparing short, simple, proactive theses, rather than take a defensive position, adding that the use of English and Spanish to communicate is important.\n\nTurkish stance on events of 1915\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as \"genocide,\" describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nIn 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan – then Turkey's prime minister, now president – expressed condolences to the descendants of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915.\n\n*Writing by Havva Kara Aydin",

A total of 77 people were killed and many were injured.\n\nLos Angeles was the place where Consul General Mehmet Baydar and Consul Bahadır Demir were martyred by an Armenian terrorist on Jan. 27, 1973.\n\nCan Oguz, Turkey's consul general in Los Angeles, said Turks will never forget their martyrs.

With specific details, they feature graphics and photos of terrorist attacks and assassinations by Armenian terrorists, along with a detailed timeline.\n\nThe exhibits include rare images telling the stories of the fallen diplomats along with high-resolution photos created using artificial intelligence.\n\nThe showcases also focus on Turkey's efforts to reveal the truth and facts about the 1915 events when Armenian population of Ottoman Empire lost their lives during the “difficult conditions” of World War I.\n\nTurkey's position on the 1915 events remains that the death of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.\n\nTurkey objects to presenting the 1915 events as “genocide,” describing them a tragedy in which both Turks and Armenians suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia under the supervision of international experts to examine the issue.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's recent statement on the events has led to harsh criticism from Ankara.\n\n*Writing by Havva Kara Aydin in Ankara",

We consider the statement, which is devoid of all legal and scholarly legitimacy, as null and void,\" said Fahrettin Altun in a statement.\n\nStating that the remarks lend support to the Armenian diaspora’s baseless slanders and are rooted in US domestic political calculations, Altun said they not only fail to help Armenians get out of their difficult situation but also ill-serve US interests.\n\n\"The Biden administration’s decision to mis-portray history out with an eye on domestic political calculations is a true misfortune for Turkey-US relations. It is wrong and damaging to label the 1915 events as anything but a tragedy,\" he underlined.\n\nMentioning how Turkey’s history is founded in cultures coexisting in tolerance and peace, he stressed that what happened during World War I must be evaluated within the context of \"European imperialism and the disintegration of an empire.\"\n\nArmenian terrorist organizations killed dozens of civilians –citizens of Turkey, Azerbaijan, France, Sweden and the United States– in assassinations, shootings and bombings.We remember the victims with exhibitions in Istanbul and Los Angeles, starting today. pic.twitter.com/cUTuDe7jqW\n\n'US administration failed'\n\n\"By taking this latest step, the current US administration not only fails to appreciate the richness of the history which we share with our brothers and sisters in these lands, but also attempts to exploit the struggle of our entire nation for its own narrow political calculations,\" he added.\n\nCiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's efforts to recognize historical tragedies and the pain of the common past, Altun added however that Erdogan had opposed, consistently and decisively, any attempt to “weaponize” history against countries or nations.\n\n\"Our President has repeatedly called on historians, intellectuals and other thinkers to come together and present a scholarly approach to the 1915 events. He stressed that we were neither afraid nor ashamed of the realities of our history,\" he added.\n\n\"The mischaracterization of our history in a politicized and deliberate manner will not stop us from welcoming and protecting our brothers and sisters, with whom we share a common destiny,\" Altun noted.\n\nStating that Turks and Armenians, along with many ethnic and religious communities, have lived together for centuries, he added that Turkey still remembers how millions of the Ottoman Empire’s Muslim and Christian subjects suffered the horrors of imperialism and war during World War I and respects their memory.\n\n\"Moreover, we do not let those tragic events define our relations with our neighbors today. We do not harbor grudges or hostility towards any country, including Armenia. Our initiatives so far to advance our relations with Armenia, on the basis of mutual respect, are proof of this, and no diaspora group can change that fact,\" Altun added.\n\n'Extremely unfortunate, saddening day'\n\nLamenting that this is an \"extremely unfortunate and saddening day\" for Turkey's bilateral ties with the US, due to Washington choosing to cast a shadow over Turkey's honorable history, Altun said Turkey absolutely rejects the Biden administration’s labeling of the 1915 events as \"genocide.\"\n\n\"The US authorities have unfortunately bowed down to the demands of certain lobbies by making the statement. We would have expected them to take into consideration earlier statements by Sahak Mashalian, the Patriarch of Turkish Armenians, and Pedros Sirinoglu, President of the Association of Armenian Foundations, where they urged certain countries to refrain from exploiting past sufferings for short-term political gain, and to have noticed the great difference between indisputable facts and malevolent lobbying campaigns,\" Altun said.\n\nHe added that Turkey, as always, will continue to maintain dialogue and cooperation with its allies for the sake of the Turkish people’s interests and the country's national security, but that Turkey will also never shrink from opposing all attempts to smear the nation’s history or tarnish the Turkish people’s good reputation.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Biden called the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" breaking American presidents' long-held tradition of refraining from using the term.\n\nTurkish stance on events of 1915\n\nTurkey’s position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

However, it is nationalistic, not Marxist-Leninist like ASALA.\n\nClaiming that it only received support from the Armenia diaspora rather than foreign partners, JCAG only targeted Turkey because it believed that attacking other countries would damage the so-called \"Armenian struggle.\"\n\nIt initially gained notoriety by claiming responsibility with ASALA for an attack on Turkey's Ambassador in Vienna Danis Tunaligil on Oct. 22, 1975.",

      "content": "On the eve of another April 24, the Turkish public is curious whether the US will join the dozens of countries that labeled the tragic events of 1915 as a \"genocide.\" While Turcophobia remains high in specific segments of the Western public and Turkish-American relations are passing through a turbulent period, US President Joe Biden might this time overlook the strategic importance of Turkish-American relations or the historical and moral dimension of 1915 to name what happened as a so-called \"genocide.\"\n\nWithout a doubt, such a move would further hamper bilateral relations, which are already in a somewhat derailed situation. It could also have heavily negative implications on Turkey's relations with the wider Western world and frustrate Turkish society with the West, among other things. However, the least likely thing that could happen in such a situation would be for it to present a contribution to Turkish-Armenian reconciliation, as those who fervently insist on the politicization of 1915 and it being recognized as a so-called \"genocide\" argue. It instead would fuel Turcophobia and Islamophobia in the West and end any possibility of understanding between Turkish and Armenian nations to understand each other's sufferings during the last decades of the Ottoman Empire, within which they co-existed for hundreds of years.\n\nOn the road to 1915, a multitude of external and internal dynamics played a role. Worsening the social and economic situation of the larger Muslim elements in Ottoman Anatolia from the 1830s in parallel with the accelerated infiltration of Western capitalism, which utilized and enriched the non-Muslim minorities of the empire, including Armenians, created a profound tension between inter-communal and inter-religious relations. Demographic pressure caused by the expulsion of Turks from the Balkans as a result of the 1877-78 Turco-Russian War and the Balkan Wars in 1912-13, as massacres of Turks at the hands of Christian gangs and armies further heightened ethic and religious tension between the constituents of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThese were in addition to the increasingly systematic European intervention into Ottoman state and societal affairs on the side of Armenians and generally of Christian minorities during the long 19th century, aptly regarded as the age of imperialism and age of nationalism. During this period, European diplomatic representatives extended extrajudicial protection they had under the Capitulation regime. This led progressively militant Armenian nationalists to think an independent Armenia could be formed with Western powers' assistance. Against this background, some segments of the Ottoman Armenian community rejected to seek common ground to defuse aggravating inter-communal tension between Armenians and Turks and Kurds. Instead, terror was embraced, particularly by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), a.k.a the Dashnaksutyun, to intimidate Muslims and, more importantly, a strategic tool to provoke a harsh Ottoman response, which eventually would lead to a Western armed intervention on the side of Armenians. Sasun rebellions in the 1894-1904, occupation of Ottoman Bank HQ in Istanbul in 1896, the Khanasor terror campaign against Kurds in eastern Anatolia in 1897, and an assassination attempt against Sultan Abdulhamit II in 1905 are among the most well-known chapters of the ARF's terror campaign to this end before 1915.\n\nTherefore, the events in 1915 should be understood as an escalated continuation of decades of tension between Ottoman Armenians and Ottoman Turks and Kurds. Again, after the very goal of establishing an independent Armenia through terror and the help of the advancing Russian Army, Armenian nationalists launched an extensive terror campaign against Muslims in eastern Anatolia, which resulted in massive tragic losses from both sides and the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians to Ottoman Syria.\n\nNeither back then, nor currently, Western intervention or expectations of a solution from the West have not created any solution for Armenians. On the contrary, the politicization of the 1915 events and exploitation of Armenians' sufferings, without mentioning the massacres against Turks and Kurds, by ultra-nationalist elements of the Armenian diaspora and Turcophobic Westerners have only prevented the building of a mutual understanding between Turks and Armenians and normal relations between Turkey and post-Soviet Armenia.\n\nTo create a common language of dialogue between Armenians and Turks, which would eventually lead to understanding each other's traumas and heal open wounds bleeding for decades, a historical commission should be formed, as suggested by Turkey. The commission would examine all available related documents and enable scholars to discuss the reasons and consequences of what actually happened in 1915.",

      "content": "Turkey opposes narratives seeking to sow hostility between the Turkish and Armenian people by distorting their shared history, Turkey’s communications director said on Tuesday.\n\n“Today, we face a narrative that tries to create animosity from history by distorting the shared history of the Turkish and Armenian peoples, who have lived together peacefully for centuries. And we are against this narrative,” Fahrettin Altun told a virtual one-day International Conference on the Events of 1915.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Altun said the opinions shared during the conference will help reveal the truth about the events.\n\nHe said that the pains suffered in the past in every part of the world reach our day not only through history books but also with tales parents tell their children, as well as memories, but that unfortunately through time some events become myths and lose touch with reality.\n\nMentioning how the 20th century witnessed a very important event in that regard, he said at the end of World War I, three great empires – Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Tsarist Russia – dissolved.\n\nHe said the first global war claimed around 38 million lives, which caused great trauma on all sides.\n\n“Tens of thousands of Turks and Armenians lost their lives as a result of the conflicts in eastern Anatolia,” he said.\n\n“Amid these events, some Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin in the eastern provinces – who made the army's movements difficult, attacked the people, and harbored gangs cooperating with the enemy army – were subjected to a 1915 relocation to Syrian lands within the borders of the Ottoman Empire.”\n\nThese Armenians living in certain areas were relocated with the aim of protecting civilians and defending the lands under wartime conditions, he explained.\n\n“While this security measure was being implemented, unfortunately, under the conditions of the war that lasted with all its violence, undesirable events also occurred. There were casualties and pains suffered by Turks and Armenians,” he said, outlining the background of the events of 1915.\n\n“These events formed the basis of the debate and even slanders that have come down to our day,” he explained.\n\n​​​​​​​Altun said Turkey deeply feels the pain suffered during the implementation of the Relocation Act adopted by the Ottoman Empire in 1915.\n\n\"As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated, we believe that standing in unity for pain and joy is a requisite to ‘being Turkey together’,” he said.\n\nHe noted that Turkey opposes narratives of hostility and added: “Regardless of their background, religion, ethnicity, or sect, we know very well that people have lived in these lands as brothers and sisters for centuries.”\n\nAltun stressed the cause of ongoing debate over the events despite the passage of over a century since, decrying how some insist on making the events of 1915 into political and ideological fodder and using them for “imperial aims.”\n\n“Decisions made by different parliaments on controversial historical matters don’t make them democrats but instead stubborn and tyrannical,” he said, referring to various parliaments passing ill-informed resolutions on the events.\n\nTurkey’s sole aim on every issue is to serve truth and justice, he said, adding: “Our wish to reach the truth is not for political gain, but for the truth itself.”\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s oft-repeated call to open up all international archives on the 1915 events, and for a scholarly approach to the events, amounts to, said Altun, “a call for truth.\"\n\n“Claims of a so-called Armenian genocide are the precursor of the current phenomenon known as ‘post-truth.’ Such claims have nothing to do with the facts and are based solely on political considerations,” he said.\n\nDecisions by parliaments and the remarks of foreign heads of state on the issue have no credibility for Turkey, he said.\n\nThe main thing is to “have a rightful place in the hearts of the children of this land from past to present,\" Altun explained.\n\n“We hope that this conference will play an important function to recall the historical background of the events of 1915 and prevent attempts to bring our country to its knees through the slander of the so-called Armenian genocide,” he concluded.\n\nAcademics, researchers, experts, and representatives of NGOs from Turkey and other countries such as the US, Russian, Germany, France, and Ireland will contribute to the conference, according to the Turkish Communications Directorate.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

      "content": "A delegation of senior Turkish diplomats will pay Egypt an official visit early in May, Turkey's foreign minister announced on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking on a televised interview on a private Turkish broadcaster, Mevlut Cavusoglu said Egypt had invited the Turkish side for the visit, which is to be held at the deputy foreign minister-level.\n\nAfter this meeting between delegations, Cavusoglu said he could meet his Egyptian counterpart as well.\n\nTurkey and Egypt have recently released statements on bilateral ties, suggesting an expected restoration in relations after more than seven years of political estrangement.\n\nThe two countries exchanged positive signals on establishing contacts and dialogue, including the possibility of holding talks to demarcate their maritime borders in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nOn recent tensions in the Black Sea, Cavusoglu said Turkey wanted the body of water to be a \"sea of peace\" and added that all coastal countries had come together and agreed to determine their maritime jurisdictions.\n\nThe US had sent a diplomatic notification to Turkey on April 9 for the passage of two of its warships through the Turkish straits, but Cavusoglu said the US canceled the note verbally pending official notification. The vessels were to arrive in the Black Sea on April 14-15 and remain until May 4-5.\n\nIf the US warships do not pass, Cavusoglu said the mandated 15-day notification period would start over.\n\n\"Turkey strictly follows the Montreux Convention [Regarding the Regime of the Straits]. Neither Russia nor anyone else should have concerns about that,\" he added\n\nThe Montreux Convention was signed in 1936, giving Turkey control over its straits and authority to regulate the transit of naval warships.\n\nUnder the terms of the convention, the US, as a non-Black Sea power, is obligated to give Turkey prior notice before sending warships through the Bosphorus and Canakkale waterways, which connect that sea with the Marmara Sea.\n\nThe US is reportedly already carrying out reconnaissance flights above the Black Sea intended to monitor Russian naval activity and surveil potential troop movements in Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014.\n\nThe US has said Russia is amassing its forces near Ukraine's eastern border at a level unseen since 2014 when it occupied and later annexed Crimea, and began support for separatists in the eastern region of Donbas.\n\nThe seven-year conflict between government forces and Russia-backed separatists has claimed more than 13,000 lives, according to the UN. Fighting has intensified in recent weeks with the Ukrainian military saying one soldier was killed in clashes with separatists on Sunday.\n\n'So-called Armenian genocide'\n\nResponding to a question on the US position on the events of 1915, Foreign Minister Cavusoglu underlined that if Washington follows international law, it would not recognize the \"so-called Armenian genocide.\"\n\n\"We believe the US will not make such a statement on April 24. But, let's assume they do make such a decision, just because a politician said such a thing, it doesn't mean it should be accepted. The UN made its decision openly in 1948,\" he added.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.",

      "content": "Turkey and the US stand to benefit from reinvigorated diplomatic relations, Turkey’s recently appointed envoy told Anadolu Agency amid significant differences between the NATO allies.\n\nIn an interview, Ambassador Hasan Murat Mercan, who took office last month, said the two nations should adopt a \"realist but positive\" approach towards Turkish-American relations and pledged to work to enhance cooperation in areas of mutual interest.\n\n\"Turkey is much stronger with its military power, cultural history and human infrastructure when compared to other countries in the region. There may be cyclic ups and downs in Turkish-American relations. This is very natural.\n\n\"But when you look at long-term relations, we should see what the mutual interests are between the two nations. Let's continue to talk about the existing problems, but those problems should not poison our cooperation in other areas,\" said Mercan.\n\n\"If we focus on existing problems, only develop strategies to solve those problems and put our relations into this framework, we will not be able to make much progress,\" he added.\n\nHe said Turkey and the US are the two key countries that have a longstanding alliance relationship and are members of transatlantic solidarity.\n\nMercan said cooperation on regional stability and development focused on common interests will be important both for Turkey and the US.\n\n\"Given that, I propose moving ahead together. When we do that, the problem of trust will disappear by itself,\" he added.\n\nRelations between Turkey and the US have been running tense over a range of issues, including US support for the PKK terror group's Syrian branch the PYD-YPG, its inaction against the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) and Ankara's purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system.\n\n'Turkey more important than ever'\n\nMercan said decision-makers engaged in Turkish-American relations know about Turkey's importance, and if the US wants to maintain a presence in the Middle East and Europe, Turkey is one of the most important actors in the region.\n\n\"The reason is simple: Turkey's geography, human resources, population, threats in the region and global repercussions of these threats.\n\n\"If the US continues to be interested in these issues, then Turkey will emerge as an indispensable country, which is very natural. Besides, new balances are emerging after the COVID-19 pandemic. At this point, Turkey's importance in the region is much more than ever before,\" he added.\n\nThe diplomat said there are serious differences and \"issues that we cannot agree on,\" but these differences should not harm Turkish and US interests in the medium and long term.\n\nFETO among 'serious issues'\n\nThe ambassador also touched on US inaction against FETO, the group behind the July 15 coup attempt in Turkey, calling the case one of the \"serious issues\" between the two countries.\n\n\"The erroneous policies of the US administrations and system on this issue are saddening,\" said Mercan, adding that Turkish-American relations are too important to be undermined due to stances on this matter.\n\n\"This is an issue that negatively impacts our relations and extremely bothers our country and people. That the perpetrators of a coup attempt staged in Turkey are sheltering in another NATO ally always saddens us.\n\n\"That will harm our relations and add more question marks. That is true for the PKK/PYD, too,\" he added, referring to the Syrian branch of the PKK terror group, which has received huge support from Washington.\n\nFETO and its US-based leader Fetullah Gulen orchestrated the defeated coup of July 15, 2016 which left 251 people martyred and 2,734 injured.\n\nAnkara also accuses FETO of being behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police and judiciary.\n\nMercan said the so-called Armenian genocide is brought up by the US public and media each year, which is another issue that harms relations between Turkey and the US.\n\n\"No US president has so far used the so-called word 'genocide' and [President Joe] Biden is the one who decides on whether to use it or not and Ankara will take necessary steps toward such a move,\" said Mercan.\n\nHe said Turkey's explanations are clear and independent historians should work together to shed light on this issue.\n\n\"That has been a proposal by Turkey since the very beginning, but unfortunately, the Armenian side has yet to take a step,\" said the envoy.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.\n\n*Servet Gunerigok contributed to this story",

      "content": "*The author is an alumnus of Trinity College Dublin, specialized in Master of Laws (LL.M.) in International and Comparative Law. His main focus areas are Turkey-EU relations, Eastern Mediterranean and contemporary debates in Turkish foreign policy. He has a special interest in public international law, EU law and Late-Ottoman Era legal-political developments.\n\nAlthough 2020 will definitely be remembered as a tough and unprecedented year, Azerbaijan’s legendary victory over Armenia in Upper-Karabakh was not overshadowed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the Upper-Karabakh Ceasefire Agreement is not just an ordinary border agreement, yet it will also be marked as a manifestation of the reality that even the most complicated “frozen conflicts” can be resolved through diplomacy and/or use of military force.\n\nNevertheless, there are a number of actors that have underestimated the peaceful settlement of the Upper-Karabakh Conflict and are aiming to downplay Azerbaijan’s technological superiority by ignoring Turkey’s inclusion as a “game-changer” in the conflict. Unfortunately, the European Union (EU) is one of them. For instance, the EU top diplomat Josep Borrell’s recent statements on the possibility of the troop deployment of the EU in the region demonstrate how the Union is devoid of rational policymaking. Having perplexed by the decades-old delusions that emanated from Armenian claims, Borrell said that the EU will not deploy troops on the ground and will not do what Turkey did. Actually Borrell’s attitude could not hide the EU’s estrangement from its long-term objectives aiming to consolidate the EU’s position as a farsighted and credible actor.\n\nWith all due respect, even if the EU’s reluctance to intervene in a conflict in the South Caucasus can be understood under its diligence to remain a global soft-power, Borrell’s remarks on Turkey are unacceptable. After these mind-boggling remarks, Resolution 1597 adopted by the Belgian House of Representatives on Upper-Karabakh on Dec. 18 has also proved Belgian politics’ narrow-mindedness apparently caused by one-sided Armenian narratives. Meanwhile, the Belgian parliament’s reference to the events of 1915 constitutes a clear resemblance to the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s baseless remarks, alleging that the Turkish-Azerbaijani operations in Upper-Karabakh were a continuation of the so-called “Armenian genocide”. It is saddening to observe that many Belgian parliamentarians pay so much attention to a defeated prime minister, who is being strongly criticized even by his own people. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Belgian House of Representatives has been taken hostage by “narrow interests catering to domestic politics.”\n\nAnkara-based political analyst Ali Bakeer is of the opinion that “the outcome of the conflict and the constant Turkish political position in supporting Azerbaijan, not to mention the role of Ankara-made drones, show that Turkey is becoming stronger in the Caucasus ”. Bakeer’s approach is quite plausible because Turkey’s contributions to the settlement of the Upper-Karabakh conflict are versatile. Principally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan summarized the newly established political order in the region: “Karabakh is no longer a frozen conflict, it now signifies a glorious victory”.\n\nWhile evaluating Turkish achievements in the region, Azerbaijan’s decisiveness and rational policymaking under the administration of President Ilham Aliyev ought to be praised first. Unlike Yerevan, Baku has a well-rounded understanding of the nature of post-Cold War conflicts. Recalling the “Joint Vision 2020” report (2000) of the Pentagon, wars in the 21st century have long been foreseen as “network-centric wars” by the United States. According to this report, the American military strategy has to be based on “Full Spectrum Dominance” in space, high seas, air and information technologies. Apparently, Azerbaijan has had a certain perception of these expectations. Dr. Can Kasapoglu from Istanbul-centered think-tank EDAM thinks that besides diversifying her military arsenal, Azerbaijan also improved her military doctrine and military science knowledge. Moreover, apart from the fraternal solidarity between Turkey and Azerbaijan, burgeoning Turkish dronization trends in the Azerbaijani Armed Forces showed the vulnerability of traditional warfare, according to Kasapoglu. Kasapoglu summarizes these trends as a transfer of a complete robotic warfare doctrine and concept of operations to Azerbaijan. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the side which used the terrorist PKK and its regional affiliates on the front lines, namely Armenia, lost the war. This war, once again, proved that drawing on terrorism cannot be a choice for an independent state. Now, thanks to the Turkish aspirations to consolidate the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, “Karabakh is no longer a frozen conflict”.\n\nIn his renowned book On War, the German war theorist Carl von Clausewitz asserts that “war is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means.” Although his state-centric arguments have been opposed and proved wrong quite a few times, they are still valid in many cases. In the Karabakh example, President Aliyev was of the view that peace can only be achieved by ending the Armenian occupation and cannot be ensured without Turkey. Under these principles, the possibility of a military intervention was surely on the table and was considered as the last resort to regain the occupied Azerbaijani territories. Thus, the determination of Azerbaijan and Turkey to carry out military operations in the region, once again, proved the Clausewitzian paradigm. These two countries continued to insist on a peaceful and law-abiding settlement of the conflict -as a political prerequisite- while military operations were successfully conducted on the field. Eventually, Azerbaijan’s use of her right to self-defense complemented her political and diplomatic objectives.\n\nTurkey, Azerbaijan and European security: Need for updated EU policy\n\nRecently, by safeguarding the narrow-minded interests of the Greek-Greek Cypriot duo, the EU has shown restraint in calling for the security of “European borders”. The ongoing refugee crisis between Turkey and Greece is a clear example of this. The EU is obviously faced with a serious dilemma, underlining, on the one hand, its priorities as maintaining European security and protecting “European borders”, and on the other hand, avoiding a direct involvement in the preservation of peace in such a critical region dominated by non-EU-member European actors. Meanwhile, downplaying and criticizing/condemning Turkish achievements in Upper-Karabakh will certainly deepen this dilemma.\n\nBefore the settlement, the EU tacitly promoted inconclusiveness and ambivalence in Upper-Karabakh by turning a blind eye to Armenian brutality in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. However, in the absence of a common will with regard to the Upper-Karabakh conflict among the EU member states, the EU’s active neutrality policy in favor of Armenian “postponement diplomacy” has failed. The EU’s appeasing attitude towards Armenia’s well-known offensive mentality, which was once again solidified with the Belgian Parliament’s unfortunate resolution, is even more puzzling. Overall, the EU showed no intention to manage the Upper-Karabakh conflict in a proper and decisive manner. Now, the Union stands merely as a “passive observer”.\n\nThe EU’s top diplomat’s latest statement is a manifestation of this consequence: the EU leadership is seemingly committed to remain a passive observer.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the need for an updated EU policy is evident. First of all, there are convincing reasons for the EU to take the view that Turkey is an undisputed game-changer and peace-broker in this conflict. Secondly, there are also convincing reasons for the EU to believe that Turkey’s moves have changed the “game” in favor of European and Western interests by creating a counterweight to Russia with Azerbaijan. Thirdly, Turkey has good neighborly and multifaceted relations with the countries in the region. In a political atmosphere where the EU is concerned about the Russian resurgence and where Turkey is welcoming the Union’s policies to build partnerships with the countries in the Caucasus, the EU should prioritize updating its ill-fated stance towards Turkey. Unless the Union changes its rhetoric on Turkey and the Turkish military presence, the tilting of the Russian dominance in the South Caucasus will merely remain a forlorn hope.\n\n**Opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency.",

      "content": "An academic in the US argued on Thursday that there is \"no document proving that the killing of Armenians was an official policy\" of the Ottoman Empire in 1915.\n\nSpeaking at Turkish-American Security Foundation (TASFO), Michael Gunter of Tennessee Tech University explained that well-known documents published by Armenian author Aram Andonian in 1919 to supposedly prove deliberate massacres, were fabrications.\n\nHaving conducted research on the events of 1915, Gunter said Armenian claims had a greater audience because Christian Armenians had gained more sympathy in the Christian West.\n\n\"Also, Muslim Turks were historical enemies of the West. Since Armenians also spoke Western languages better than Turks, they were able to convey their messages to the West better,\" explained Gunter, a professor of sociology and political science.\n\nEmphasizing that he hoped an academic dialogue would be initiated between the advocates of Turkish and Armenian theses in the US, Gunter pointed out that Turkish-Americans would be willing to do so, but Armenian-Americans had never accepted such an endeavor.\n\nHe stressed that many Armenians in the western parts of the Ottoman Empire had not been deported, adding that some Armenians had been killing innocent Muslims for decades without interruption.\n\n\"For genocide to exist legally in international law, planning or premeditation must be proven, and it has not been proven on this issue,\" he said.\n\nTurkish stance on the 1915 events\n\nTurkey’s position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some of them sided with the invading Russians and revolted against the Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of these incidents as “genocide”, describing them as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia as well as international experts to tackle the issue.",

      "content": "The Armenian allegations surrounding the events of 1915 have been politically \"instrumentalized\" in the construction of the Armenian identity, according to experts.\n\nFrench historian Maxime Gauin, a guest academician in the Center For Eurasian Studies, and Mustafa Serdar Palabiyik at TOBB University of Economics and Technology in Turkey's capital Ankara commented on the 1915 events and Armenia's approach to the issue.\n\nGauin said the 1915 events were instrumentalized to consolidate Armenian identity against the fear of assimilation in the Armenian diaspora -- especially in France and the US -- triggering hostility against Turkey instead of effectively protecting their language and culture of the traditional establishments.\n\nHe went on to say that Armenia used its \"eternal victim status\" to hide occupation and the ethnic cleansing of Azerbaijanis from 1992 to 1994.\n\nHe further said that Armenia would no longer need the financial support of the diaspora if an Armenian government could attract Turkish and Azerbaijani investment after settling disputes with these neighboring countries.\n\nAccording to Gauin, the US and members of the EU use allegations relating to the 1915 events as a political tool.\n\nHe argued that the majority of the US Congress ignored the interests of their own country to vote in favor of recognizing \"genocide\" in a vote last fall. However, the move was politically motivated and even members of congress recognizing that the decision came following rising tensions with Turkey.\n\nPalabiyik, for his part, said references to \"victimization\" have played a significant part in the modern Armenian identity.\n\nHe asserted that Armenian state policy sought to force the international community to recognize the Armenian \"genocide,\" a goal that was included in the country's constitution in 1990.\n\nStressing that the \"so-called Armenian genocide\" was engraved into the education system of the country, he said the events 1915 were always kept alive in the mind of Armenians throughout education.\n\nHe added that the 1915 events were one of the most pressing matters of Turkey's political relations with the US and EU, underlining that some EU countries recognized the 1915 events as \"genocide\" after Turkey became an EU candidate in 1999 -- one of the main indicators raising suspicions that the issue has been politicized.\n\nPalabiyik argued that the events of 1915 were cited whenever there was political tension between Turkey and the US or the EU.\n\nThe Armenian diaspora was the driving force behind the so-called \"genocide\" allegations, he said, adding that the Armenian diaspora may be more dominant in these efforts than Armenia itself.\n\nHe said the diaspora was much stronger than the Armenian government in financial and political clout and that it sought to influence Erevan's domestic and foreign policy.\n\nPalabiyik concluded that some Armenian politicians saw the diaspora leaders as \"foreign powers\" who do more talking than financially contributing to the country.\n\nTurkish stance on 1915 events\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

      "content": "As the coronavirus pandemic marches into mid-April, with weeks of lockdown behind most of the world but untold weeks still ahead, people from around Europe and the globe – Italy, the U.K., Australia, and Armenia – are all dealing with the unprecedented pandemic in their own way.\n\nSabrina Messina, who divides her time between Turkey and Italy, was in Istanbul when the quarantine began in her home country, one of the worst-hit countries by coronavirus.\n\nEverything was normal at the beginning and “all of a sudden a lot of cases popped up in the north of Italy,” the 50-year-old banker told Anadolu Agency from her house on the island of Sicily, southwest of the “foot” of Italy.\n\nShe tried to fly home directly, as usual, but on her day of departure Messina found out that “all the flights to Italy had been canceled,” and it was then that she started panicking.\n\nEventually Messina made her way to home via Malta to Sicily, where the seriousness of the pandemic grew clearer to her.\n\n“All of my friends who live in Milan” – in northern Italy, especially hard hit by the epidemic – “were very scared, and I got a lot of messages from my doctor friends saying that the situation was out of control and soon the whole region would be closed,” she related.\n\nWhen the first decree announcing a lockdown in northern Italy was issued on March 8, it sparked a massive, frightened exodus to the south, ironically and inadvertently spreading the virus nationwide.\n\nMessina said she found people’s attitude “very natural,” as “nobody knew what was going on and everybody was trying to find comfort with their own family.”\n\nRecalling the positive morale Italians showed, as in playing instruments or serenading their neighbors or healthcare workers from balconies, Messina said: “But this was only the first week of the quarantine.”\n\nNow, after working from home for some time, Messina accused the Italian government of making “mistakes at the beginning” of the outbreak, including underestimating the number of cases.\n\n“We’re entering the second phase,” she said. “And we have to face economic problems.”\n\n“Unfortunately and fortunately at the same time, we depend on Europe and we will see what they will decide,” she added.\n\nThe European Union’s response to the pandemic has been widely criticized as too little, too late, as in Italy alone the death toll has reached nearly 19,000.\n\nMessina also said the virus gives the world a chance to rethink its attitude on climate change as well as cruelty to animals.\n\nOur actions are pivotal\n\nOceans and a hemisphere away, Andrew Priestley from Melbourne, Australia is among many others in his country who are in self-isolation.\n\nThe 37-year-old swimming instructor and his family have been under lockdown since mid-March.\n\n“I’m at home with my wife and two young daughters,” Priestley told Anadolu Agency.\n\n“Doing a lot of reading,” Priestley added. “My wife bought me a really complex Lego set for my birthday, which I enjoyed building.”\n\nHighlighting the importance of self-quarantine, he said: “Our actions as a nation are pivotal to ensuring our health system can help the people who really need it and [that] we minimize the number of really serious cases.”\n\nAccording to Priestley, the Australian government closely followed expert advice from chief medical officers at the state and national level, including a government body called the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.\n\n“The Australian public, in my view, have been very good on the whole following advice to minimize the spread of this pandemic,” he added.\n\n“The actions of the general public will be the major factor in how our nation deals with this crisis,” he said.\n\n“This is an unprecedented situation and one that is proving very difficult for governments to respond to around the globe.”\n\nAuthoritarian impulse\n\nFor Giorgos Tsilis, who has been living in London for the last six years, his work life has changed due to the epidemic as he works longer hours “because some of the admin staff are on furlough.”\n\nThe 36-year-old admin assistant said that his personal life has changed as well, as he can’t go out to pursue his hobbies, including playing football, rehearsing with a band, “and of course no pubs, restaurants,” he added.\n\nAs in London – like in Turkey – a maximum number of customers are allowed in supermarkets at a time, shopping takes a bit longer, he added.\n\n“Things will get worse as the weather is getting better,” warned Tsilis, who is originally from Greece. “It's harder to stay home when it's sunny, especially in this country.”\n\nWhat really worries Tsilis is the recession in the wake of the epidemic: “It will be a crisis that will affect everyone and I suppose will challenge more the smallest economies.”\n\nHe is also afraid that some governments will take the opportunity to become more authoritarian, adding: “We already have seen that even here in Europe, in Hungary for example.”\n\nLast month, Hungary’s parliament granted sweeping new powers to Prime Minister Victor Orban to tackle the pandemic, with critics decrying the lack of a sunset date on the powers.\n\nWorking from home not so easy\n\nJust east of Turkey, in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, Vazgen Karapetyan has been working from home for almost a month now.\n\n“The entire country is on an emergency and quarantine,” he said.\n\n“Borders are closed for ordinary citizens. Only cargo can go out and get in through closed borders,” added the 50-year-old international development specialist.\n\nFor Karapetyan working from home turned out not to be very easy.\n\n“The biggest difficulty is the surprisingly increased volume of work, and the actual non-stop mode of it,” he explained.\n\nThe coexistence of work and home in the digital age “makes you more vulnerable to instant messaging ‘intrusion’ from different sides, which distracts attention and takes a lot of time,” he said, citing messages from “colleagues, friends, kid’s teachers” all begging for a reply.\n\nAnother difficulty that parents with school-age children face is helping your children deal with online learning, he added.\n\nAccording to Karapetyan, the Armenian government’s quarantine is not strict enough. “You can still see a lot of people and cars on the streets.”\n\n“This, of course, will result in a prolonged quarantine, with more substantial negative economic consequences for the country,” he warned.\n\n“At the same time, the government is absolutely open and transparent,” he said, adding: “Information on coronavirus spreads in Armenia, and [it] takes necessary preventive measures to cope with the danger.”\n\nBack in Australia, Priestley remains optimistic, saying: “We are in this together and we will come through this together.”\n\nDrawing on the epic 1915 Battle of Gallipoli, which saw tens of thousands of Turkish, Australian, and New Zealand soldiers die in one of the most ferocious battles of World War I, Priestly added: “As Australia and Turkey’s shared history has taught us, the very toughest of times are when we show our best.”",

The U.S. claims the system could be used by Russia to covertly obtain classified details on the jet and is incompatible with NATO systems.\n\nTurkey, however, countered that the S-400 would not be integrated into NATO systems and would not pose a threat to the alliance.\n\nIn June, Trump responded to a question on the issue, saying he puts America first in all matters but cannot turn a blind eye to Turkey's unfair treatment by the prior administration, referring to former U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of Turkey's request to purchase F-35 defense systems.\n\nArmenian issue in Congress\n\nThe U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution recognizing Armenian claims on the events that transpired in 1915 mid-December, which gained the anger of Ankara.\n\nAlthough it is not legally binding, the adoption of the resolution on a very sensitive issue was not welcomed by Turkey.\n\nIt also showed that Democrats and Republicans can work together when it comes to an anti-Turkey agenda.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia, plus international experts, to examine the issue.\n\nIt's hard to expect what the new year will bring for ties between the two countries as Trump's impeachment trial and 2020 presidential elections will continue to dominate the country's agenda for much of the year.\n\n*Beyza Binnur Donmez from Ankara contributed to the story",

Turkey does not need the U.S.,\" said Kilic, and stressed that the NATO allies have a \"mutual relationship.\"\n\nHe said Turkey is the country the U.S. is going to need the most should it want to carry out operations in the Middle East.\n\n\"Therefore, Turkey needs the U.S. as much as the U.S. needs Turkey; even the U.S. needs Turkey more,\" he added.\n\nHis remarks came amid recent congressional efforts against Turkey, including sanctions and recognizing Armenia genocide claims in 1915, which cleared the House of Representatives and Senate floors in recent weeks.\n\nKilic said lawmakers behind the moves are benefitting from the bills and harming Turkish-American relations. He warned that the sanctions threat is an \"extremely wrong approach.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed Friday a massive defense spending bill which included several anti-Turkey items.\n\nThe ambassador said sanctions and the Armenia resolutions are on shaky ground and brought up for political ambitions.\n\n\"We should see that these steps are harming Turkish-U.S. relations,\" he added.",

      "content": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday that Ankara may close two bases in Turkey where U.S. soldiers are stationed \"if necessary\".\n\n\"If necessary, we will hold discussions with all our delegations, and if necessary, we may close Incirlik [air base in southern Adana province] and Kurecik [radar station in eastern Malatya province],\" Erdogan said in a televised interview.\n\nSpeaking about a resolution passed in the U.S. Senate on Armenian allegations over the events of 1915, Erdogan said the bill was \"completely political,\" adding: \"It is very important for both sides that the U.S. does not take irreparable steps in our relations.\"\n\n\"We regret that the polarization in U.S. domestic politics has had negative consequences for us and that some groups abuse developments about our country for their own interests in order to weaken [President Donald] Trump,\" Erdogan added.\n\n“We are not going to stand empty-handed. Let me say very clearly and openly: Is it possible to speak about America without mentioning Indians? It is a shameful moment in U.S. history. Similar things happened in Africa. Is it possible to put aside the French massacres in Rwanda, Algeria?\n\n“They did slave trade in cells from Senegal to America. What will we do to explain these to the international community? We have documents in our archive. We will reveal that the history of the West is the history of racism and colonialism. While all these massacres and genocides are standing, they cannot say anything to the nation which has a proud history like us,” said Erdogan.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution recognizing Armenian claims on the events that transpired in 1915.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.\n\nDrilling in Eastern Mediterranean\n\nStressing that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves beneath the Eastern Mediterranean, Erdogan said Turkey may work in the region with companies that are \"strong in the international community\".\n\nNoting that a security and military cooperation deal with Libya’s UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) would go into effect after its ratification in the Turkish parliament, he underlined that with the deal, both Turkey and Libya's rights would be protected and that Turkey would not allow any unilateral steps to be taken.\n\n\"If the Libyan government requests military support, Turkey will make its decision,\" said Erdogan, reiterating that Turkey is \"ready to provide all kinds of support to Libya.\"\n\n\"We may take the necessary steps within international law,\" he added.\n\nOn Nov. 7, Ankara and the Tripoli-based Libyan government reached two separate memorandums of understanding (MoUs), one on military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe memorandum on maritime boundaries asserted Turkey's rights in the Eastern Mediterranean in the face of unilateral drilling by the Greek Cypriot administration, clarifying that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) also has rights to the resources in the area. It went into effect on Dec. 8.\n\nTurkey has consistently contested the Greek Cypriot administration’s unilateral drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nSince the spring of this year, Ankara has sent two drilling vessels -- Fatih and most recently Yavuz -- to the Eastern Mediterranean, asserting the right of Turkey and the TRNC to the resources of the region.\n\nTurkey’s first seismic vessel, the Barbaros Hayrettin Pasa, which was bought from Norway in 2013, has been conducting exploration in the Mediterranean since April 2017.\n\nAthens and Greek Cypriots have opposed the move, threatening to arrest the ships’ crews and enlisting European Union leaders to join their criticism.\n\nTurkey’s counter-terrorism operation in northern Syria\n\nErdogan said Turkey's goal with its anti-terrorism operation in northern Syria was to maintain peace for Syrians, not to \"seize its oil\".\n\n\"Neither the U.S. nor Russia could eliminate YPG/PKK terrorists there [from northern Syria] as they promised. So we have to do it,\" he added.\n\n“They are particularly disrespectful to our Kurdish brothers,” said Erdogan.\n\n“They define the YPG/PKK as Kurdish,” he said, referring to Western countries. “In my opinion, this is disrespect to the Kurds.”\n\nErdogan said they camouflage the YPG/PKK under the name SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces).\n\nHe stressed that the YPG/PYD is an offshoot of the PKK terrorist organization.\n\n“The ringleader of the YPG/PKK, Ferhat Abdi Sahin, also known as Mazloum Kobani, is the spiritual son of the jailed leader of the PKK terrorist organization [Abdullah Ocalan]. The heads of the U.S. and Russia speak with this man. We can’t get results with this situation. Besides, this man is being sought with a red notice,” said Erdogan.\n\n“I also said this in the NATO meeting. If we are together in NATO, if we fight against terror together, how can you talk with these ringleaders? Firstly, we have to fix this.”\n\nHe stressed that the fight against PKK terrorists should be carried out jointly and as it was against Daesh/ISIS terrorists.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring to eliminate terrorists from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.\n\nIn its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union -- has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the Syrian offshoot of the PKK.\n\nDuring the interview, Erdogan also said he would speak over the phone Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about returning FETO terrorists.\n\n\"We talked about this at the NATO meeting. The main topic in the phone call will be Libya, but we will talk about returning FETO members as well,\" he said.\n\nErdogan said the number of FETO members is very high especially in the U.S., Germany, France, Belgium and Greece and they are given the opportunity to settle there.\n\n*Writing by Davut Demircan, Erdogan Cagatay Zontur and Havva Kara Aydin",

      "content": "Turkey will press ahead with its anti-terror operation in northern Syria until its goals are reached, said the country’s National Security Council on Tuesday. Operation Peace Spring, launched last month, “which contributes to peace and stability in the region, will continue until it reaches its goals, while taking all precautions to prevent harm to civilians,” the council, chaired by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said in a statement after meeting at the presidential complex in Ankara. The council also said that Turkey expects the U.S. and Russia to fulfill their agreements with Ankara as soon as possible to clear terrorists from areas of northern Syria, including Tal Rifat and Manbij. The council reiterated that Turkey will continue its determined fight against the terror group Daesh/ISIS and is open to any cooperation towards that end. “We call on the international community to support Turkey, which aims for the safe and voluntary return of Syrians to their country without any discrimination based on ethnicity or religion,” the council also said. Turkey on Oct. 9 launched Operation Peace Spring to eliminate YPG/PKK terrorists from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.\n\nAnkara wants YPG/PKK terrorists to withdraw from the region so a safe zone can be created to pave the way for the safe return of some two million refugees.\n\nUnder two separate deals with the U.S. and Russia, Turkey paused the operation to allow the withdrawal of YPG/PKK terrorists from the planned northern Syria safe zone.\n\nBut the terrorists have failed to withdraw from some areas and continue to attack both soldiers and civilians.\n\nIn its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and EU -- has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants. The YPG is the PKK's Syrian offshoot.\n\nThe council also condemned decisions about the events of 1915 based on false and unfounded claims, likely referring to a recent U.S. House of Representatives resolution on the subject. Turkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.

In 1877, there were around 8,000-12,000 refugees in Hagia Sophia for around 4 months. These immigrants were very sick.\n\nChildren, elderly men, and women can be seen in the painting, he said, adding this is perhaps a forgotten story of Hagia Sophia. There is a surprising and important story of Hagia Sophia being a refugee shelter.\n\nAlso commenting on the 1915 events during the Ottoman era, he noted when the Muslims are oppressed, the West said it is a civil war, but when the Christians are oppressed they call it a “genocide”.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.\n\nForgotten refugee crisis\n\nSpeaking at the event -- entitled the Balkan Losses: Forgotten Immigrants of The Russo-Turkish War -- held by the Turkish Historical Society, Holt said there is a lot of false information about the influence of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, adding Turks have always been depicted as cruel in the West.\n\n“According to the West, the Turks were always cruel and were never oppressed. The West has never seen Turks as victims or oppressed,” he said.\n\nHistorian Holt also presented his latest book \"The Balkan Reconquista and Turkey's Forgotten Refugee Crisis\" at the event.\n\nThe book uncovers the difficulties faced by Turks who were forced to migrate during the 1877-78 Russo-Ottoman war. Also, in his book, Holt tells the story of the suffering of Muslims during migration, and what they went through after coming to Istanbul during the Russo-Ottoman War of 1877–1878.",

      "content": "Turkey rejects a resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Armenian claims, the country’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.\n\n“We reject the resolution H.R. 296 entitled ‘Affirming the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide’ that is adopted today by the U.S. House of Representatives as expressing the sense of the latter,” the ministry said in a statement, referring to the events of 1915.\n\nEarlier, the House of Representatives passed a resolution recognizing the so-called Armenian genocide, with lawmakers voting 405-11.\n\n“The resolution, which has apparently been drafted and issued for domestic consumption, is devoid of any historical or legal basis,” the ministry said.\n\nNoting that the resolution is not legally binding and a “meaningless political step,” the ministry said it is only addressed to the Armenian lobby and anti-Turkey groups.\n\n“Those who felt defeated for not being able to forestall Operation Peace Spring would be highly mistaken should they think they could take vengeance this way,” it said, referring to Turkey’s anti-terror operation in northern Syria that was launched on Oct. 9.\n\nIt added that the Turkish government and people consider the resolution “totally null and void.”\n\n“The resolution as it stands is both against U.S. and international law as it is an incrimination against the principles defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,” it said, noting the absence of any verdict from a competent court announcing the 1915 events as a crime of genocide.\n\n“On the contrary, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a milestone judgment which stipulates that the 1915 events constitute a legitimate subject for debate,” it noted.\n\nThe ministry also underlined that the debate on the events is about history, not politics, and recalled Turkey’s proposal made in 2005 on the establishment of a Joint Historical Commission.\n\nIt said the proposal was rejected by the Armenian side.\n\n“Undoubtedly, this resolution will negatively affect the image of the U.S. before the public opinion of Turkey as it also brings the dignity of the U.S. House of Representatives into disrepute,” the ministry said.\n\n‘Resolution null and void’\n\n“Ruined big game w/#OperationPeaceSpring,” Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also wrote on Twitter following the approval of the resolution.\n\nTurkey launched Operation Peace Spring earlier this month to eliminate terrorists from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey’s borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria’s territorial integrity.\n\n“Those whose projects [in northern Syria] were frustrated turn to antiquated resolutions. Circles believing that they will take revenge this way are mistaken. This shameful decision of those exploiting history in politics is null&void for our Government&people,” he added.\n\nTurkey’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun also warned that those who voted in favor of the resolution will be responsible for the “deterioration” of bilateral ties.\n\n“The U.S. House of Representatives vote on the Armenian Resolution is deeply troublesome for anyone who cares about the US-Turkey relationship. Those who voted for this resolution will be responsible for the deterioration of a critical strategic relationship in a turbulent region,” Altun wrote on Twitter.\n\nTouching on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s stance regarding the events, Altun said: “President @RTErdogan has already expressed sympathy and conveyed his condolences to the Armenian community. He also expressed our willingness to establish a joint historical commission to investigate what happened during the First World War.”\n\nAltun also urged the Armenian people not to let their history become “a tool of domestic political considerations,” adding Turks and Armenians lived together in the region for centuries.\n\n“Politicization of history for political needs is unacceptable,” he said.\n\nHe also warned of interventions from third countries.\n\n“History taught us that such interventions by outsiders, who have already brought much pain to our region, will not bring any good to our relations.”\n\nTurkey’s Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin also condemned the resolution on Twitter.\n\n“Armenian resolution of the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the embarrassing examples of using history as a tool of politics.\n\n“Those who accuse Turkey of genocide should look at their history first and the bloody history of the Asala and PKK terror groups.”\n\nFounded in 1975, the Armenian terror group ASALA is responsible for hundreds of bloody terrorist attacks. It martyred more than 30 Turkish diplomats and officials in various attacks during that decade.\n\nIn its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union -- has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.\n\nDraft bill on sanctions\n\nTurkey’s Foreign Ministry also condemned the approval of a draft bill that foresees sanctions on Turkey on the grounds of Operation Peace Spring.\n\nBipartisan U.S. lawmakers also passed a bill 403-16 that seeks to impose sanctions on Turkey over its anti-terror operation in northern Syria.\n\n“We strongly condemn the adoption of a draft bill that envisages sanctions against Turkey on the basis of Operation Peace Spring in the U.S. House of Representatives today [Oct. 29],” the ministry said in a statement.\n\n“The draft bill, which targets our senior officials and our Armed Forces, is incompatible with the spirit of our NATO Alliance and contradicts the agreement reached on Syria with the U.S. Administration on 17 October,” it added, referring to a deal to pause the operation for 120 hours to allow the withdrawal of YPG/PKK terrorists from the planned safe zone.\n\nIt also noted that the U.S. officials -- who disregarded the difference between an ally country and a terror group and also legitimized a terrorist group with their rhetoric and actions -- cannot achieve anything with unilateral sanction threats.\n\n“We urge the U.S. Congress not to exploit bilateral issues for domestic political consumption and to act in line with the spirit of our Alliance and partnership.\n\n“We call on the U.S. Administration to take necessary steps to prevent the further deterioration of our relations,” it noted.\n\nAltun also slammed the approval of the draft bill.\n\n“Attempting to sanction a NATO ally in order to protect a terror organization can only [be] described as a strategic shortsightedness and detachment from realities on the ground.”\n\n“The House of Representatives’ draft bill threatening sanctions against Turkey is in direct contradiction to the spirit of a strategic alliance,” he added.\n\nAltun noted that the draft bill cannot deter Turkey’s resolute stance to fight terrorism and said the bill only threatens to damage bilateral relations.\n\n“These brazen efforts to damage our relationship will have long-lasting detrimental consequences in many areas of existing bilateral cooperation.\n\n“We will continue to convey our legitimate security concerns in all international platforms and to fight against terrorism in all its forms for international security and peace in our region,” he added.",

      "content": "Turkey on Sunday commemorated a diplomat who lost his life in 1983 in Brussels, gunned down by an Armenian terrorist on the street outside his home.\n\nDursun Aksoy was born in 1944, in the village of Islamkoy in the southwestern Turkish province of Isparta.\n\nIn November 1976, Aksoy joined the Foreign Ministry, and three years later, he was appointed to Turkey's Embassy in Brussels as an administrative attaché.\n\nA father of three, Aksoy was scheduled to return to Turkey in October 1983 -- the same year his youngest son turned 4.\n\nOn July 14, 1983, at 10.30 a.m. local time (0830GMT), about to start his car outside his home on Avenue Franklin Roosevelt in Brussels, Aksoy was shot twice, in the neck and chest, by an Armenian terrorist.\n\nThe 39-year-old Turkish diplomat died at the scene, martyred on the job.\n\n\"I was looking out the window,” said eyewitness Serge van Peborrgh about the assassination “I saw the victim getting behind the wheel. There was a person standing outside the car. At that moment, I heard two shots.\n\n“I didn't know what happened. The victim was left where he was. The attacker quickly fled the scene.\"\n\nThree Armenian terrorist groups took responsibility for the murder -- the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG), and the Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA).\n\nAfter an Armenian suspect was arrested in the Netherlands, the eyewitness was brought to the country and identified him. Belgium then secured his extradition.\n\nIn Belgium, he was expected to be convicted, but a number of witnesses supplied with him an alibi, saying he was in France on the day of the assassination. His subsequent release provoked great indignation in Turkey.\n\nAlthough Belgian authorities pledged that the investigation would continue, today -- over 35 years later -- no other suspects have been apprehended, and Aksoy's killer remains unpunished.\n\nWhen Omer Aksoy, the martyred diplomat’s father, heard the terrible news about his son on the radio, he immediately came to the capital, Ankara.\n\n\"We welcome Armenians with open arms in Turkey. They're shooting us out there,\" he said.\n\n- Victims of Armenian terror\n\nSome 31 Turkish diplomats and public servants were killed worldwide by Armenian terrorist groups between 1973 and 1986, according to Armenian Terror, a 2007 study by late Ambassador Omer Engin Lutem, also a scholar of Armenian studies.\n\nThe killings occurred in a host of countries around the world, including the U.S., Britain, Austria, France, Italy, Belgium, Vatican City, Spain, Lebanon, Greece, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Portugal, and Iran.\n\nThe study said that Armenian churches and political parties, feeling threatened by the assimilation of Armenians who moved abroad, decided to revive extremist national emotions to prevent assimilation and to protect their identity.\n\n- Interest in Armenian propaganda waning\n\nIn recent years Armenian propaganda has gotten less interest in the international arena, an expert on Armenian terrorism told a conference held in Ankara this May.\n\nAlthough the Armenian lobby tried to fuel media speculation that President Donald Trump would call the events of 1915 a \"genocide,\" in fact he did not, said Christopher Gunn, a professor at Coastal Carolina University in the U.S. state of South Carolina.\n\nGunn added that the popularity of Armenian propaganda is shrinking.\n\nAt the conference, Gunn also spoke about Armenian terrorists who were involved in international terrorism such as Soghomon Tehlirian, Gourgen Yanikian, and Monte Melkonian, who are behind the killing of several Turkish diplomats and their relatives in various parts of the world.\n\n- Events of 1915 in eastern Anatolia\n\nASALA and other Armenian terrorist groups have cited the so-called “genocide” of 1915 as a pretext for their murderous campaigns.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

      "content": "Still flying high at 84 years old, a Turkish pilot living in the U.S. says he has flown all around America, chasing his aviation hobby.\n\nSevgin Oktay told Anadolu Agency that his passion for the sky started when he was a young boy watching airshows by pilots in northern Turkey, at Safranbolu airbase in the Karabuk province.\n\nAfter finishing high school in Turkey, in 1955 Oktay left his motherland to go to university in the U.S., and earned master’s and doctoral degrees at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nTaking a job at tech giant IBM, Oktay started working as a technology manager in research and development.\n\n“There was this small airport near IBM, I’d go there during lunch breaks and have half-hour flight training courses,” he said. “I got my pilot license in 1968. Since then, for more than half a century, I’ve been flying.”\n\nSaying he was responsible for various divisions at IBM, Oktay added: “I would go to [them] by plane and fly above the company for a short while.”\n\nIn 1993, when he retired from IBM, he transformed his passion into a business by founding his own company, Oktay Enterprises International. At the firm, he helped customers with business trips as a flying patent agent.\n\nOktay said he had flown to all corners of the U.S. and its territories, from Alaska to Bahama.\n\nOn his Alaska flying, which covered more than 15,000 kilometers in three weeks, he said: “There was a conference in Seattle, first we went there by plane then moved on to Alaska. It was a magnificent place. We moved towards the polar circle.”\n\nOktay said when he flew near Alaska mountains at an altitude of 6,500 meters, he had to use compressed oxygen. “Pilots need to use oxygen cylinders after 3,000 meters, because human beings can faint if there’s not enough oxygen,” he explained.\n\nAsked whether he had faced danger while flying, he remembered a near miss at Prince Edwards Island in eastern Canada.\n\n“We were caught by a terrible storm,” he remembered. “The weather looked fine but there were black clouds ahead.” He said he didn’t change course because the flight controllers said there was no need for concern.\n\n“It was raining like we were going through a waterfall. The plane began shaking. If we had turned around, the plane might have flipped over… Then, all of a sudden, all the equipment was out broken… I tried to get our bearings using the old method, a liquid compass,” he added.\n\nGuided by light from within the clouds, he said he was finally able to land. “We dodged a close call,” he said.\n\nAs for charitable work, Oktay along with the Turkish Consulate in New York once presented a Turkish family whose daughter was suffering from a bone disease with a free aerial tour of the Big Apple.\n\n- Turkish Anti-Defamation Alliance\n\nIn addition to his flying, Oktay also has an active civil life, and founded the Turkish Anti-Defamation Alliance (TADA), a group fighting smear campaigns against Turkey over the events of 1915.\n\n“We Turks truly fight against Armenians’ smears in the U.S. I’ve done a lot of research on this subject… They blatantly lie,” he said.\n\nStating that he presented projects to Turkey’s New York Consulate, Oktay said he was thinking about producing a short movie supporting the Turkish arguments about that time.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to examine the issue.\n\n*Writing by Ali Murat Alhas",

We substantially succeeded in the March 31 local elections,” said Erdogan, addressing a gathering of the ruling Justice and Development (AK) Party in capital Ankara.\n\nHe noted that the AK Party got 44.4% of the votes which is the second highest rate of their party in terms of local elections to date.\n\nHe called the mayoral elections of Istanbul questionable, adding: “All doubts must be eliminated so that the people feel relieved.”\n\nHe also referred to the documents which showed that there was a very serious organized set up in Istanbul polls.\n\nRecalling the opposition party's concerns over objections to Istanbul poll results, Erdogan termed the situation “tragicomic” as the party has the right to challenge the results according to the electoral law.\n\nMillions of Turkish voters cast their votes nationwide on March 31 in local elections to choose mayors, city council members, and other officials for the next five years.\n\nEkrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), took oath as mayor of Istanbul earlier this month, amid AK Party's agitation over voting irregularities.\n\nErdogan refuted rumors that the AK Party had given up hope on the Istanbul results, stating that the party will continue its legal struggle.\n\nReiterating that his party and coalition partners had paved the way to reach a common ground in Turkey, he invited all Turkish citizens, who had not sold their hearts and minds to external powers and terrorists, to join their alliance.\n\nHe insisted that there is no polarization in Turkey with the exception of one entity which supports terrorist organization.\n\nSpeaking about the events of 1915, he said the Armenian relocation was neither a genocide, nor a great disaster, which took place under troublesome conditions a century ago.\n\n“Millions of Armenians would not be living across Europe, U.S., North Africa, Caucasus, if allegations against us were true,” Erdogan added.\n\nNoting that parliaments of the countries are not suitable places to seek truth, he said historians and scientists should check the archives.\n\nHe also criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for declaring April 24 as a day to mark the so-called Armenian genocide.\n\nErdogan named several communities which were exposed to “real genocide” including millions of Muslims in Palestine, Myanmar and Bosnia, and Jews in Europe.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nErdogan said the legitimacy of Turkish measures taken against terror threats in Iraq and Syria is indisputable.\n\nSpeaking about recent differences with the U.S., he said: “We will continue taking steps to clear terror swamps in Syria and procure S-400 and similar security entrenchments.”\n\nFollowing protracted efforts to purchase an air defense system from the U.S. with no success, Ankara decided in 2017 to purchase the Russian S-400 system.\n\nU.S. officials have objected to the deal, claiming that the S-400 would be incompatible with NATO systems and expose U.S. F-35 fighter jets -- which Turkey also has a deal to buy -- to possible Russian subterfuge.",

      "content": "Turkey’s Foreign Ministry spokesman on Friday blamed France for its role in massacring the Turks a century ago by arming Armenians.\n\n\"The French have a role in arming Armenians and massacring Turks a century ago,\" Hami Aksoy said at a news conference in capital Ankara.\n\n“We will not forget [French President Emmanuel] Macron’s declaring April 24 as a day for commemoration [for the so-called Armenian genocide],” Aksoy said.\n\nFrance held its first national day of commemoration on Wednesday.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nThe spokesman said archives of the Armenian side had not been revealed completely, contrary to Armenian claims.\n\n“If Armenians actually show the courage to reveal the archives, the truth will be out. Unfortunately, they continue misleading the world and the young generation,\" he said.\n\nTurkey's position on the events of 1915 is that the deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia took place when some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.\n\nResponding to recent remarks by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe against Turkey regarding the events, Aksoy said: “I would like to point out that this attitude, which does not suit the head of an ally country, will not remain unanswered.”\n\n‘Threatening language’\n\nRegarding U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's remarks about Turkey on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington earlier this month, Aksoy said: “We see that the U.S. administration has restarted the use of threatening language but we’ve seen it before it does not work.”\n\nPence had said Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 defense systems could potentially pose a risk to NATO.\n\n\"Turkey must choose. Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in the history of the world, or does it want to risk the security of that partnership?\" Pence said.\n\nAksoy said: “It is impossible to accept this expression regarding our country. The U.S. should understand that it will not get any result through impositions.”\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Turkey have reached a fever pitch in recent months with Turkey set to begin receiving the advanced S-400 Russian surface-to-air missile system that Washington said will jeopardize Turkey's role in the F-35 fighter jet program and which could trigger congressional sanctions.\n\n\"We are part of the F-35 program. We are making payments regularly. Our pilots are being trained there. The delivery of the aircraft have started. We will not take a step back,\" Aksoy said.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. use of F-35s as an \"element of threat\" does not suit relations with the ally country.\n\nStating that the contacts with the U.S. continue to resolve the problems between the two countries, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson said: “We expect concrete steps from the U.S. in the main subjects regarding our country’s security, particularly on PYD, YPG, and FETO [terror groups].\"\n\n*Writing by Nilay Kar Onum",

      "content": "The events of 1915, invariably placed high on the world's agenda every year, especially in late April, have again, and also quite expectedly, been brought to the attention of the international community this year too, particularly on account of the recent resolutions passed by the French and Italian parliaments. The events of 1915, known as the \"Armenian question\" today, date back to the Treaty of San Stefano, signed at the end of the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War. The Armenian question reached its peak in 1915, in the final years of the Ottoman state, and persisted into the Republican era, becoming an intractable problem of the new regime. The Armenian question underwent a major transformation process with the foundation of the republic and took on a different character with the onset of the Cold War era. Today, the events of 1915 have become an issue known the world over thanks mostly to the commemorative events organized every year around April 24. As of today, the Armenian question is a foreign policy problem for Turkey used and abused by the parliaments of numerous countries, which have so far adopted resolutions, bills, and legislations in order to manipulate their internal public opinions. What has also contributed to the worsening of the problem is the erection of monuments, statues, columns etc. dedicated to the events of 1915, even in seemingly quite irrelevant places.\n\nToday the Armenian question has evolved into a grave problem bearing heavily on the Turkish-Armenian relations as well as Turkey's relations with many countries, first and foremost those in the West. International organizations frequently make references to the events in question, Turkey is subjected to various criticisms. The events of 1915 are cited in, for example, the European Union progress reports, European Parliament decisions, UN statements, and in the reports and statements of many other bodies. More importantly, the events of 1915 have been officially recognized as a genocide by more than 30 countries since 1965, and in some of these countries, it constitutes a crime even to openly say that such a genocide never took place. When we analyze the historical trajectory this problem has followed, we find two particularly important junctures standing out.\n\nThe first of these was the Treaty of San Stefano signed at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 (famously known in Turkey as the \"War of 93,\" in reference to 1293, the year in the Islamic calendar when the war took place). And the second was a resolution consisting of five articles adopted by the Uruguay Senate and its House of Representatives on April 20, 1965. Starting from that momentous date, the genocide allegations have been voiced increasingly loudly, beginning, over time, to have negative impacts on Turkey's relations with Armenia.\n\nEventually, two border crossings that connect Turkey to Armenia (the Akyaka and Alican crossings) were closed on April 3, 1993 due to the disputes over the events of 1915 and the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, and also due to the resolutions passed by various parliaments about the said events, which are frequently brought up in the international community by the Armenian diaspora across the globe. These two border crossings remain Turkey's only land borders closed. These historical problems between the two countries have caused the diplomatic relations between them to come to a complete stop as well. Armenia is as adversely affected by this situation as Turkey. Diplomatic relations with Armenia are conducted through third countries (via Georgia). Armenia nowadays is a country that has access to the outer world mostly through Iran, since its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed, and it is becoming more and more isolated in the region. When we look at the Armenian history, however, we find their relations with the great empires and civilizations in the region showing varying levels of progress. For example, Turkish-Armenian relations embarked on a particularly positive trajectory during the Seljuk period. Armenians previously lived under the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Arabs, but when the Seljuks conquered the region, they cooperated with the Turks to save themselves from the Byzantine oppression.\n\nThe relations of the Armenian community leaders (amira) with the Ottoman state administration, as well as the services and overall impact of the Armenian intellectuals in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the fields of science, art, literature and in bureaucracy remain subjects that need to be thoroughly examined. Vartan Artinian, for example, notes that the majority of Armenian students who graduated from the universities of Rome, Padua, and Pisa in the first quarter of the 19th century were Ottoman Armenians, adding that these intellectuals, all of whom were graduates of the Muradyan College, were prolific writers, particularly in the field of education, and translated many works. Similarly, there was a large number of Armenian youth sent abroad for educational purposes during the periods of \"Tanzimat\" (the administrative reforms) and \"Islahat\" (the Imperial Reform Edict) in the 19th century, and the contribution of these young Armenians to the modernization of the empire is too extensive an issue to be dealt with in the scope of this article.\n\nIn the Ottoman era, Armenians worked in almost every official position in the service of the Turkish state, proving themselves a very hard working and capable community. They assumed significant positions as members of the senate, deputies, foreign ministers, ministers of the Private Treasury, members of the Council of State, consular officers, interior ministers, provincial governors, ministers of public works, ministers of forestry and agriculture, ministers of the PTT (post office), finance ministers, and they also worked in gunpowder factories, and in the fields of education, press, architecture, customs, art, trade, law, music etc. Many of the Armenians in these positions came from a highly refined and versatile Armenian intellectual class. Zeidner points out in this respect that Armenians occupied one-third of the official positions in the Ottoman state. Marchese and Breu draw attention to the fact that Armenians, in the vacuum generated by the Greek independence war against the Ottomans, began to play a more active role in the Ottoman elite circles, in the economic middle class, in the production of gunpowder, in the judiciary, in the field of architecture, and so on, since they were known as millet-i sadika, or the \"most loyal nation.”\n\nFoundations of modern Armenia\n\nThe foundations of the state now called Armenia were laid down through the settlement of a large Armenian population in and around Yerevan in the 19th century with the help of Russia. One of the oldest inhabitants of the region, the Armenian community has a very long history and has been an important factor in the history of the region. However, the fact that the Armenian community lived in a region dominated by the most powerful empires of the region, such as Russians, Persians and Ottomans, necessarily caused them to be affected by the struggles between the three. At this point, it is time for Armenians to draw a new road map by distancing themselves from the manipulations of the diaspora as well as Western countries at a time when Turkey, Russia, and Iran -- currently as well as historically the leading actors in the region -- are moving closer together toward common goals. Although doing what has so far not been done and trying what has not been tried yet contains elements of risk, change has always been an exciting process due to the inherent possibility of success.\n\nWith Turkish-Armenian relations entering their second millennium, more parliaments passing new resolutions just no longer triggers the intended reactions from Turkey. Such parliamentary resolutions, on the contrary, render the matter at hand more and more ordinary while also disrupting the normalization process between the two nations. Western countries passing new resolutions about the events of 1915 does not mean anything for Turkey. Just like in the first parliamentary move in this direction by Uruguay in 1965, all the subsequent legislations mean nothing to Turkey and are void of any legal basis. Additionally, there has been no ruling delivered so far by an international criminal court regarding the events of 1915.\n\nAs will be seen below, by far there have been nearly thirty resolutions passed in this process that began in the Cold War period. And we are highly likely to see more of such resolutions in the future. But in terms of Turkish-Armenian relations, it is time to do the undone, and try the untried.\n\nIsn't it worth taking such a step, or taking such a risk, based on the millennial historical relations between the two peoples? So far all other methods have been tried by the two parties; why not employ the language of peace this time and walk the path of reconciliation? Otherwise, looking at the current trajectory, we can surmise that the lobbying work to have more states recognize the events of 1915 as a genocide will continue, and as a result, their number will accordingly continue to increase one by one.\n\nIt must also be known that the recent decision taken by President Emmanuel Macron in France -- the cradle of democracy -- has no legal basis. Just like the April 24 resolution, which violates the decisions of both the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the French Constitutional Court, the events of 1915 have no legal basis, either. The reason is that the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is based on the 1948 Convention. And since this convention does not and cannot cover the time before 1948, the Armenian genocide allegations cannot be legally brought to the ICJ. In addition, this matter has already been legally resolved between Turkey and Armenia through the treaties of Moscow and Kars, and the Treaty of Lausanne. [7] Therefore, the recent resolutions adopted by the French and Italian governments have no legal bases, and are merely intended to advance a certain agenda. And it must be known that against such efforts, Turkey will continue to maintain its firm stance.\n\nIn France, the Jewish lobby has the strongest position, and the Armenian lobby comes after that. As in the resolutions passed in the parliaments of other countries, Armenian lobbies played a significant role in the passing of these resolutions in France and Italy. The current course of relations has been benefitting neither Armenia nor Turkey, and it will continue to serve only to further cement the image of \"victimized Armenians\" as opposed to that of the \"oppressive Turk/Turkey.” Such resolutions also result in the incitement of more hatred and breeding of more rancor between the societies in question. This, despite the continual admonitions to the parties involved from the EU, the EP, the UN, and several other international organizations regarding the promotion of efforts toward a reconciliation between the two societies, taking steps to achieve a lasting peace, and eradicating all hatred. The repeatedly emphasized and implied message in all such statements and admonitions is that Western countries are able to uphold and continuously provide these peaceful values thanks to their strong democracies whereas Turkey and other countries are constantly lagging behind and always have room for progress. A look at the following list, however, will reveal that the statements and actions of these Western countries are far from integrity given the numerous scandalous resolutions they have adopted since 1965.\n\n1. Resolution of the Uruguay Senate (1965, 2004)\n\n2. Resolution of the House of Representatives of the Greek Cypriot administration (1982)\n\n3. Resolutions of the Argentine Senate (1993, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008)\n\n4. Resolutions of the Russian Duma (1995, 2005)\n\n5. Resolutions of the Canadian House of Commons (1996, 2002, 2004)\n\n6. Resolution of the Greek Parliament (1996)\n\n7. Resolutions of the Lebanese House of Representatives (1997, 2000)\n\n8. Resolution of the Belgian Senate (1998)\n\n9. Resolutions of the Italian Parliament (2000, 2019)\n\n10. Joint Statements by Pope John Paul II and the Armenian Catholicos Karekin II (2000, 2001)\n\n11. Draft Law of the French Parliament (1998, 2000, 2001, 2019)\n\n12. Resolution of the Swiss National Council (2003)\n\n13. Resolution of the Slovak Parliament (2004)\n\n14. Resolution of the Dutch Parliament (2004)\n\n15. Resolution of the Polish Parliament (2005)\n\n16. Resolutions of the German Bundestag (2005, 2016, 2018)\n\n17. Resolution of the Venezuelan Parliament (2005)\n\n18. Resolution of the Lithuanian Parliament (2005)\n\n19. Resolution of the Chilean Senate (2007)\n\n20. Resolutions of the Swedish Parliament (2000-2010)\n\n21. The Parliament of the Republic of Bolivia (2014)\n\n22. The Czech Parliament House of Representatives (2015)\n\n23. The Austrian Parliament (2015)\n\n24. The Brazilian Federal Senate (2015)\n\n25. The Bulgarian Parliament (2015)\n\n26. The Syrian Parliament (2015)\n\n27. The Luxembourg Parliament (2015)\n\n28. The Senate of Paraguay (2015)\n\n29. Latin American Parliament - PARLATINO (Panama) (2015)\n\nNow, the question begs itself regarding these resolutions. If the real aim is to resolve historical disputes through peaceful means, why are all these resolutions based on the statements of only one party? What do Turkey and the Turkish people think on these issues? One wonders if there are any countries and parliaments on this list, concerned about how these resolutions are likely to shape the image of the Turkish people in the international arena. Or is it that every single country passes such resolutions in favor of its own internal and external conjunctural interests and with only their own internal public opinion in mind? Regardless of the reasons, it cannot be denied that these resolutions, which -- let us reiterate once again -- have no legal basis, do more harm to the Turkish-Armenian reconciliation process than good.\n\nTurkey has taken many steps in the last 15 years to ensure that the events of 1915 are better understood, and toward the resolution of the dispute, and a reconciliation between the two parties. Some of these steps were the foundation of the Vienna Armenian-Turkish Historians' Platform, the Joint Historians Commission, and the signing in 2009 of the \"Protocol on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Armenia\" in Zurich. Even though the hand of peace that Turkey has extended on this issue has been left in the air most of the time, it has never abandoned its attitude of peace and reconciliation. As a country that inherited an imperial past and a tradition that sees cultural differences as richness and diversity, Turkey should never tire to cry out to the rest of the world that such parliamentary resolutions will never be able to harm the millennial relationship between Turks and Armenians. The Armenian side, on the other hand, should begin to take more courageous decisions in the Pashinyan era and realize that it is high time it shook the hand extended to it in peace and friendship. Just as in the case of its relations with Iran in the region, with China on a global scale, and with Russia in its history, Armenia should now meticulously work on its relations with Turkey as well. At a time when Turkey has been closely cooperating with Russia and Iran as necessitated by the circumstances, it is time for Armenia, being one the countries in the region, to resolve all its problems with Azerbaijan and start acting together with the regional countries. This change would primarily benefit Armenia and then the countries in the region. This change is likely to turn into a major movement of peace both on a regional and global scale. To achieve this, however, Pashinyan should disband what is known as the \"Karabakh clan\" which is holding critical state positions. It is time for Pashinyan to shelve his predecessors' allegations of genocide as well as their policies on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\nAnd it is also high time that Armenians in the diaspora realized that this present trend, generated in the Cold War era, no longer interests the Turks or the Armenians as much as in the past, and no longer creates the desired effect. Turkey, where it is now, is able to view this whole issue from a different angle. It has been taking steps to reach a reconciliation between the two communities. Today in Turkey, official statements are released on April 24, there are Armenian-origin deputies in the parliament, the number of academics working in this field and the number of related university departments have increased, and also several positive steps have been taken to promote radio and TV broadcast and publication in the Armenian language. Hence, it is now the Armenian diaspora's turn to call itself to account. Since the Cold War years, Armenian politics has been shaped by the diaspora rather than the concerns of Armenia's citizens about economy, democracy, human rights, and freedoms.\n\nIt is time for the Armenian society and opinion leaders to step out of the orbit forced upon them for almost the past 50 years by the diaspora. It is time for change in the Armenian question.\n\nTranslated by Omer Colakoglu\n\n[Associate Professor Yildiz Deveci Bozkus is lecturer at the Department of Caucasian Studies at Yildirim Beyazit University in Ankara, the Turkish capital]\n\n* Opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency.",

A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy in which both sides suffered casualties.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nCavusoglu also said the PKK terror group is trying to use the Netherlands as a center for drug trade, which the group is doing from northern Iraq.\n\n\"We have to work together in order to stop this flow,\" he said.\n\nBlok, for his part, said he is positive about future of Turkish-Dutch relations and the two countries have \"very strong\" relations.\n\nHe said Netherlands is the largest foreign investor in Turkey.\n\nResponding to a question about discrimination being faced by the Turkish community in the Netherlands, Blok said: \"Discrimination is not acceptable in the Netherlands [...] Anyone who feels discriminated should go to the police, should go to a court.\"\n\nAfter the joint press conference, Cavusoglu also attended the opening ceremony of Turkey's Consulate General in Amsterdam.",

Facing history must be a term that should be used in another meaning for France,\" he said.\n\n\"While the crimes committed by the French authorities are obvious, hiding behind a term like ‘facing history’ is a result of a lobby support approach of Macron, who is in political turmoil,” he said, referring to Macron's tweet about the 1915 Armenian events.\n\nRecalling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s call in 2005 to open the archives on both sides and let scientists conduct the necessary research, Celik said the studies were prevented by the decisions taken by Armenia’s Constitutional Court back then.\n\nHe also warned that Turkey would not just condemn the move, but it will also have effects on bilateral relations.\n\nHe said Macron, cornered by months of protests by the Yellow Vest movement, is trying to rescue himself through baseless allegations instead of producing “shrewd policies” to tackle the issue.\n\nLast week, Macron announced April 24 as a day to commemorate the so-called Armenian genocide.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as \"genocide\" but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts to tackle the issue.\n\nSafe zone in northern Syria\n\nOn a safe zone in northern Syria, Celik said: \"It is not possible to say that fruitful talks with U.S. President Donald Trump were disseminated to the grassroots.\"\n\nHe said Turkey's concerns about its security were not matters of negotiation which could be extended over time.\n\nNoting that the Turkish Armed Forces has the capacity to realize any kind of operation for the country’s safety, he added: “The right thing here is putting an end to these places being a safe haven for the terrorists.”\n\nThe safe zone issue was first brought to the global stage when Erdogan visited the U.S. nearly six years ago in May 2013.\n\nIn a surprising move last December, Trump announced he was withdrawing all American forces from Syria. He made the decision during a phone call with Erdogan in which the two leaders agreed on the need for more effective coordination over the civil war-torn country.\n\nChinese policy on Uighur Turks\n\nOn the issue of Chinese authorities’ systematic assimilation policy towards Uighur Turks, Celik said Turkey respects China's integrity and security, \"but holding more than 1 million Uighur Turks in concentration camps and prisons is unlawful.\"\n\nStating that the policy carried out by the country was open to assimilation in many ways, Celik noted that many opinion leaders, artists and intellectuals of East Turkestan were missing.\n\n“If a transparent approach is adopted on this issue, it will create an opportunity to defuse tensions and allow everyone to understand what is happening,” he said.\n\nChina’s Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45 percent of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination.\n\nChina stepped up its restrictions on the region in the past two years, banning men from growing beards and women from wearing veils and introducing what many experts see as the world’s most extensive electronic surveillance program, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs many as 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang have been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to U.S. officials and UN experts.",

Cannon, an associate professor at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told Anadolu Agency on Monday.\n\nCannon, who wrote a book on the subject, said that the Armenian diaspora has built an identity around their claims about the 1915 events, so much so that they see research into these events as a kind of “denial.”\n\n\"The Armenian diaspora’s ideological representations of what occurred in 1915 have attained an unquestioning status,” he explained.\n\n“This is extremely problematic and allows for no compromise in their quest to have the events labeled as a ‘genocide’.\"\n\nCannon said that the Armenian diaspora avoid any criticism or research on this topic, as they claim the Armenians were “victimized.”\n\nHistory for historians\n\nHistory should be left for historians to research, but the Armenian diaspora doesn't want this, he said.\n\n\"Armenians have alleged that the archives in Istanbul are off limits to certain scholars. But even assuming that full archival access is granted, not only Istanbul, but in Berlin, Moscow, Boston, and elsewhere, it is difficult to see how scholarship could sway the Armenian diaspora to abandon their cherished position,” he explained.\n\n“The Armenian diaspora has insisted on nothing short of recognition by Turkey -- with all the legal, material and moral ramifications that recognition entails.

      "content": "It was 38 years ago today when Turkish diplomat Galip Ozmen and his 14-year-old daughter Neslihan were martyred by a notorious Armenian terror group in Greece.\n\nHis wife, Sevil Ozmen, and his 16-year-old son, Kaan Ozmen, were also seriously injured but managed to survive. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) claimed responsibility for the 1980 terrorist attack.\n\nDecades later, the hurt still fresh, the wound still open, Turkey is still mourning for Ozmen and his daughter, who were among over 30 Turkish diplomats and their family members martyred by ASALA and similar terror attacks between 1973 and 1984.\n\nFounded in 1975 in Beirut, Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War, ASALA is responsible for hundreds of bloody terror acts.\n\nAccording to Armenian Terror -- a 2006 study by Omer Engin Lutem, a former Turkish diplomat -- the killings spanned the continents, taking place in the U.S., Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Lebanon, Greece, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Portugal, Iran, and the U.K.\n\nThe study said that the assimilation of Armenians who migrated to other countries was seen as a threat to Armenian churches and political parties, which then decided to revive extremist national emotions to hinder assimilation and protect their concept of identity.\n\nFirst killing in 1973\n\nThough the group formed in 1975, the first killing of a diplomat and his deputy came on Jan. 27, 1973 when Gurgen Yanikyan, an Armenian, martyred Turkey's consul general in Los Angeles Mehmet Baydar and his aide Bahadir Demir.\n\nA total of three diplomats were martyred between 1973 and 1978, after which Turkish public servants abroad became targets for Armenian terrorist organizations like ASALA and the so-called Justice Commandoes for Armenian Genocide.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1984, Turkish ambassadors and diplomats were targeted around the world by ASALA and its affiliates.\n\nThese Armenian terrorist attacks intensified from 1980 to 1983, when 580 of the 699 attacks -- over 80 percent -- occurred. The terrorist attacks ended in 1986, according to the Armenian Terror study.\n\nIn order to compel the Turkish government \"to acknowledge publicly its responsibility for the so-called Armenian genocide in 1915, pay reparations, and cede territory for an ‘Armenian homeland’,” ASALA martyred Turkish diplomats in numerous bloody attacks in that decade.\n\nIn 1915, the Ottoman Empire relocated Armenians in eastern Anatolia following revolts when some sided with invading Russians, and there were Armenian casualties during the relocation process.\n\nArmenia has demanded an apology and compensation, while Turkey has officially refuted Armenian allegations over the incidents saying that, although Armenians died during the relocations, many Turks also lost their lives in attacks carried out by Armenian gangs in Anatolia.\n\nThe Turkish government has repeatedly called on historians to study Ottoman archives pertaining to the era in order to uncover what actually happened between the Ottoman government and its Armenian citizens.\n\nThe debate on so-called “genocide” and the differing opinions between the present-day Turkish government and the Armenian diaspora, along with the current administration in Yerevan, still generates political tension between Turks and Armenians.\n\nRebuffing the “genocide” allegations, Turkey has officially acknowledged past experiences as a great tragedy in which both parties suffered heavy casualties, including hundreds of Muslim Turks.\n\nThe attack at Esenboga airport on August 7, 1982, was one of the most notorious attacks of ASALA, as the group targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time.\n\nNine people died and over 80 were injured when two terrorists opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting area of the airport in the Turkish capital Ankara.\n\nThe 1981 and 1983 Paris attacks are among the group's other notable acts. ASALA terrorists held 56 people hostage for 15 hours during Turkish Consulate attack in 1981, while a suitcase bomb killed eight people -- most of them non-Turks -- in 1983 at a Turkish Airlines check-in desk at Paris’ Orly Airport.\n\nAccording to some Turkish officials, it was the Orly attack when the group lost much of its support and financial backing from the Armenian diaspora and had to dissolve.\n\nHere is a list of Turkish diplomats and public servants martyred by Armenian terrorist attacks:",

We consider the combat as a fight against threats to Turkey's territorial integrity and security,\" Hasanov said during a meeting with Anadolu Agency Director General Senol Kazanci and TRT Director General Ibrahim Eren in Baku.\n\nKazanci and Eren arrived in the Azeri capital along with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to attend the 6th Global Baku Forum.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch to clear YPG/PKK-Daesh terrorists from Afrin, northwestern Syria.\n\nAccording to the Turkish General Staff, the operation aims to establish security and stability along Turkey’s borders and the region as well as to protect Syrians from the oppression and cruelty of terrorists.\n\nSpeaking about a motion passed in the Dutch parliament supporting Armenian allegations about the events of 1915, calling them a \"genocide\", Hasanov said: \"We told them it would be better to discuss an event which actually took place, such as the Khojaly Massacre, rather than bringing a non-existent event to the agenda of the parliament.\"\n\nThe Khojaly Massacre is regarded as one of the bloodiest and most controversial incidents of the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan for control of the now-occupied Upper Karabakh region.\n\nOn the heels of dissolution of the then Soviet Union, Armenian forces took over the town of Khojaly in Karabakh on Feb. 26, 1992, after battering it with heavy artillery and tanks, assisted by an infantry regiment.\n\nWhen the massacre happened, the population of the town was more than 11,000.\n\nThe two-hour offensive killed 613 Azerbaijani citizens, including 116 women and 63 children and critically injured 487 others, according to Azerbaijani figures. One hundred and fifty of the 1,275 Azerbaijanis that the Armenians held during the massacre remain missing.\n\nAsserting the presence of a smear campaign on social media against Turkey and Azerbaijan, he said: \"We must combat these activities together. We must further enhance the cooperation between our diasporas.\n\n\"Our media organizations must enhance cooperation. I welcome the activities of Anadolu Agency and TRT. The more we enhance our cooperation the stronger we are.\"\n\nKazanci, for his part, asserted that Anadolu Agency does not separate the developments in Azerbaijan from the ones in Turkey.\n\nHe said: \"We closely follow the matters such as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the 100th anniversary of the Republic, as well as the visits of state officials.\n\n\"The matters that are sensitive to Azerbaijan are also affect us,\" Kazanci added.\n\nEren expressed solidarity with Azerbaijan and said TRT is preparing news and programs on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic.\n\n*Merve Aydogan contributed to this story from Baku",

      "content": "A “highly politicized” campaign by the diaspora Armenian community against Turkey over the events of 1915 is being waged to achieve “largely negative ends,” a U.S. academic has told Anadolu Agency.\n\nBrendon J. Cannon, a political scientist and assistant professor at Khalifa University's Institute of International and Civil Security in Abu Dhabi, said that although he felt “empathy” with Armenian campaigners, he says the community’s identity is being “held hostage to the year 1915”.\n\nSpeaking in a recent Anadolu Agency interview, Cannon said: “The claims made by the Armenian campaign purposely and willingly ignore the complexity of the year 1915 and the 20-30 years prior to the outbreak of World War I and the demise of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n“The campaign currently waged by the Armenian diaspora in places like the U.S., Germany, France, Australia and Argentina is a highly politicized campaign that utilizes dubious means to achieve unclear and largely negative ends.\n\n“Like any political movement, the campaign relies on soundbites and lacks nuance.”\n\nCannon -- author of Legislating Reality and Politicizing History: Contextualizing Armenian Claims of Genocide -- also said activists behind the international campaign “categorically deny the political aims inherently at play (including reparations, rights of return and the redrawing of territorial boundaries) and instead argue that the campaign is apolitical and concerned with closure and dignity for the descendants and survivors of what they term the Armenian Genocide”.\n\nTurkey's position is that deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia in 1915 occurred after some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nAnkara denies the alleged genocide, but acknowledges that there were casualties on both sides during the World War I events.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as ‘genocide’ but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts, to tackle the issue.\n\nCannon said that while he felt empathy with campaigners -- for whom “time literally collapsed in 1915” -- there was no evidence that the Ottoman government of the time “had an interest in murdering any of their Armenian subjects”.\n\n“Armenians living in certain areas of eastern Anatolia were deported to Syria and elsewhere in order to address the threat posed by advancing Russian and Armenian troops as well as Armenian irregulars who relied, in some cases, on local Armenian support.\n\n“It is worth highlighting that many of these Armenians with guns were Ottoman citizens.\n\n“They possessed a political agenda: the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of an independent Armenia,” he added.\n\nStating that Armenian populations in major cities such as Istanbul and Izmir were untouched, Cannon said: “The diaspora funders, supporters and lobbyists of the campaign believe that their particular ancestors were lucky to survive Ottoman plans to destroy them all.\n\n“This is false and ignores the evidence of what occurred not only in eastern Anatolia but throughout the Ottoman Empire during World War I. In other words, just because the diaspora believes a genocide occurred does not make it reality.”\n\nA “protracted, extra-legal” campaign has gained support in some European states amid the demonizing of Turkey and Turks, he added.\n\n“One, efforts at genocide recognition are greatly assisted by many in the West, particularly Europeans, who are often subject to bouts of historical guilt for excesses such as colonialism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and two world wars, for example.\n\n\"In essence, many Europeans suffer from what the Germans term Vergangenheitsbewaltigung, or the struggle to overcome the [negative] past,” he said.\n\n“That the Armenian campaign speaks to not only Armenian diaspora identity but many Europeans and their bedrock identity (self vs. other) assists us in understanding why the Armenian campaign has been successful in so many European countries.\n\n\"Simply put, the campaign represents a convenient cudgel in the hands of European politicians who score easy political points not only with diaspora Armenians but with the majority of their uninformed constituents who know little and care less about what actually occurred in 1915.\n\n\"For them the campaign’s demonization of Turkey and calls for solidarity in recognizing a human tragedy is enough.”\n\nAt the diplomatic level, disputes with foreign allies over the 1915 issue has had tangible consequences.\n\nLast year, Turkey rejected requests by German lawmakers to visit foreign troops based at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey -- a stance it took again this wek -- due to a controversial parliamentary motion in Berlin describing the deaths of Ottoman Armenians in 1915 as “genocide”.\n\nCannon noted that the issue had become embroiled in other disagreements between Ankara and European states.\n\n“When Turkey is viewed as being demanding, rude or meddlesome, politicians understand they can gain political mileage from the passage of legislation that demonizes Turkey and Turks.\n\n“The Italian resolution passed in 2000 and the more recent legislation passed in Germany in 2016 were both carried out in the face of deeply unpopular (in Italy and Germany) Turkish demands: the extradition of PKK leader [Abdullah] Ocalan from Italy in 2000; and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens to the EU in 2016.”\n\nCannon also said the present-day activists by the diaspora contained anti-Turkish elements. “That is, century-old images and caricatures, often racist and bearing no relationship to present-day realities, underpin the campaign (the terrible Turk, anti-Muslim sentiments) and still carry weight -- not only for Armenians but much of the West and Russia.”",

While it accepts many died on both sides following an uprising within the Ottoman Armenian population as Russian forces invaded, Ankara does not view the casualties as genocide.\n\nTurning to a more recent dispute between Turkey and Armenia, Merkel said Germany would use its current chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to resolve the issue of occupied Karabakh.\n\nThe enclave was taken over by Armenian secessionists as the Soviet Union broke up in the late 1980s and is recognized as Azerbaijani territory by the international community, including Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan. Despite a 1994 peace deal, border skirmishes are a frequent occurrence.\n\nAliyev said he hoped the issue would be solved according to UN resolutions recognizing Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.\n\nHe accused Armenia of provoking Azerbaijan, demolishing the mosques and graves and attacking civilians. “Armenia occupied Azerbaijan's territory… at the beginning of 1991,” Aliyev said. “Karabakh is a historical part of Azerbaijan.”\n\nMerkel said that Germany shared Azerbaijan’s view. “The solution of the Karabakh issue will also contribute to mending ties between Turkey and Armenia,” she said.",

But, we did not drive away them ...

If they have assets, we deliver it to them.\"\n\nHe also said that the magnificence of Western capital cities came from millions of Africans.\n\n\"Today, when we lift the curtain of magnificence we witness in western capitals, we see tragedy [and] tears of millions of Africans.\n\n\"Under the elegant pavements of Berlin, Paris, Brussels are life, blood, efforts and elbow greases of Africans,\" the president said.\n\nOn Thursday, the lower house of the German parliament approved a non-binding resolution recognizing Armenian claims of “genocide” during the 1915 events.\n\nThe resolution accused the Ottoman government of 1915 of allegedly carrying out “systematic genocide” against Armenians, as well as other Christian minorities.\n\nTurkey denies the alleged Armenian “genocide”, but acknowledges that there were casualties on both sides during the events taking place in World War I.\n\nAccording to Turkey's viewpoint, deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia in 1915 occurred after some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces.

We can’t do this against the will of Turkey.\n\n“This resolution does not promote enhanced cooperation with Turkey in this regard.

Senior ministers including Merkel and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel were also absent.\n\nThe motion drew a strong reaction from Ankara, which recalled its ambassador to Berlin. Leading politicians condemned the resolution and voiced concerns about the potential impact on German-Turkish relations.\n\n“One has to ask oneself ‘What would such a resolution bring?’,” Wittke said. “I would like to see freedoms -- religious freedoms, press freedom and freedom of expression -- expanded in Turkey. Will such a resolution help to achieve this? In my opinion, it will not.\n\n“This resolution is focusing on the past. It is not focusing on today. It is not directed towards the future.”\n\nCommentators have suggested that the Christian Democrat leadership did not oppose the resolution as they did not wish to appear to side with Turkey, as they have been accused of doing in the wake of the EU-Turkey deal on refugees and the investigation of a German comedian for insulting Turkey’s president.\n\nDuring Thursday’s debate lawmakers criticized Turkey’s record on democracy and human rights but Wittke argued any shortcomings would be better addressed by reviving Turkey’s EU membership talks.\n\n“We should accelerate Turkey’s EU process,” he said. “Here, there are steps that have to be taken by Turkey. This is very important. Only that way we can achieve change.\n\n“Europe and Turkey are important strategic partners. They are bearing responsibility together on many significant issues, not only in terms of the economy but also in politics.”\n\nHe added: “I believe that the EU and Turkey, Germany and Turkey, will become closer rather than becoming more divided. I am not pessimistic, I am hopeful.”\n\nThe events of 1915 saw some of the Ottoman Empire’s Armenian population side with invading Russian forces, resulting in numerous deaths in the subsequent fighting and relocation of Armenians.\n\nTurkey accepts that many died on both sides but says this did not amount to genocide and has repeatedly called for the creation of an international commission to resolve the issue.",

This is one of them.”\n\nThe deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia occurred after some sided with invading Russian forces. Turkey acknowledges that there were numerous casualties on both sides in the subsequent fighting and relocation of Armenians but denies this amounted to genocide.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts, to tackle the issue.",

      "content": "Around 10,000 ethnic Turks rallied in Berlin on Wednesday in protest at a parliamentary proposal to call the deaths of Ottoman Armenians in 1915 as genocide.\n\nThe resolution, which is to be voted on Thursday, refers to the deportation of Armenians without reference to the deaths of Muslim Ottomans during World War I.\n\nAddressing the crowd in front of the Brandenburg Gate, Turkish scholar Ali Soylemezoglu dismissed claims of the systematic killing of Armenians in eastern Anatolia in 1915.\n\n“There is no genocide in our history,” he said. “This resolution is not based on facts, it is a smear to us.”\n\nDemonstrators carried Turkish and German flags as well as placards reading “Stop distorting historical facts”, “We are against hate, we are for solidarity”, “Long live Turkish-German friendship” and “No to lies about genocide”.\n\nGokay Sofuoglu, head of the Turkish Community in Germany umbrella group, said the resolution would not help reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia but could further alienate Turkish immigrants in Germany.\n\n“We have been arguing for many years that there is a need for establishing a commission of historians, carrying out extensive research and later on taking steps in line with its outcome,” he told Anadolu Agency, pointing to disputes among historians about the events of 1915.\n\nSofuoglu said it should be up to international courts to decide whether the deportation of Armenians involved systematic killings, as claimed by the Armenian historians but disputed by many Turkish scholars.\n\n“Genocide is a special concept in law,” he said. “Decisions of parliaments change over time. In the future you may have another group getting a majority in parliament and making a completely different decision on that,” he commented.\n\nDouble standards towards Turkey\n\nAsiye Bilgin, deputy head of the influential conservative Union of European Turkish Democrats, said the motion ignored differing views on the period and backed Armenian claims.\n\n“In recent years, Turks in Germany have been uneasy about politicians’ double standards on issues related to Turkey,” she said. “They are losing confidence in German politics. We hope that German lawmakers won’t lead to the Turkish community being further alienated.”\n\nBilgin underlined that passage of the motion would have a negative impact on integration, as well as relations between Turkey and Germany.\n\nGermany’s parliament is set to vote Thursday on the controversial resolution submitted by the parliamentary groups of the ruling Christian Democrats, its coalition partner Social Democrats, and the opposition Green Party.\n\nThe non-binding resolution accuses the Ottoman government of 1915 of carrying out systematic genocide against Armenians, as well as other Christian minorities.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as “genocide” and describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government has not actively supported the controversial resolution, but also has not tried to block it in parliament.\n\nMerkel’s spokeswoman said Wednesday that she would not attend the vote on Thursday, due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nBut deputy government spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz confirmed that Merkel had voted in favor of the draft resolution, during a consultative vote in her parliamentary group.\n\nMerkel has recently faced widespread criticism from the media and opposition parties for her close cooperation with Turkey to address the refugee crisis.\n\nCritics argue that Merkel made Germany dependent on Turkey, and is giving into pressure from Ankara on many foreign policy issues, while shying away from criticizing human rights shortcomings.\n\nMany lawmakers from the ruling parties back the resolution to demonstrate to the public that they are not giving into pressure from Ankara.\n\nIf approved Thursday, the resolution would be the first one by a German parliament clearly calling the Armenian tragedy of 1915 a “genocide”.\n\nBerlin hopes cooperation will continue\n\nGerman Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schafer said Wednesday that Berlin hopes that the resolution will not undermine close cooperation betweenGermany and Turkey in addressing common challenges.\n\n“I hope and also expect that the possible decision of Germany’s federal parliament tomorrow will not bring any long-term damage to relations with Turkey,” Schafer told reporters in Berlin.\n\n“On the contrary we have many issues that we would like to address together with Turkey, including the years-long process of Turkey’s membership application to Turkey, but also many other issues. That also includes the refugee deal,” he added.\n\nTurkey's position is that deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia in 1915 occurred after some sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces. A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nAnkara denies the alleged genocide, but acknowledges that there were casualties on both sides during the World War I events.\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as ‘genocide’ but describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides.\n\nAnkara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia plus international experts, to tackle the issue.",

      "content": "Thousands of people gathered Sunday in the U.S. capital Washington D.C. for the “Peace and Solidarity Walk” with Turkey, against Armenian claims regarding 1915 events. The Turkish-American National Steering Committee (TASC) called the solidarity walk with Turkey with the motto “let history decide”.“Officially we had more than 11,000 attendees,” the Steering Committee said on its Twitter account. The walk, which included different ethnicities and religions, started from the White House and continued until the Turkish embassy in Washington. Thousands of peoples from around the world also tweeted the hashtag #letHistoryDecide. The chairman of the Turkish-American Parliamentary Friendship Group Ali Sarikaya, Justice and Development (AK) Party MP and Deputy Chairman Fatma Betul Sayan, AK Party MP Ertan Aydin and the Turkish ambassador to Washington Serdar Kilic participated in the walk. People originating from Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Algeria, Kuwait, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Malaysia, Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan etc., gathered in front of the White House from all U.S. states in the morning to show solidarity with Turkey but also to protest against Islamophobia, and the situation of Syrian refugees.\n\nWhat happened in 1915?\n\nWorld War I was a global disaster that left 15 million people dead and another 20 million injured.

[...] There is nothing to defend. First of all, the doubt that is developed on our youth and public should be removed. That is an unfair doubt. Armenian allegations are not true. They are very unfair.”\n\nTuran added that Obama’s describing the 1915 events as \"great calamity\" was a “political statement”.\n\n“Our thought is that first of all the issue should be discussed within a scientific frame, based on documents.

      "content": "By Erkan Avci and Esra Kaymak\n\nAhead of the 101st anniversary of the 1915 events, experts agree that Armenia’s pressure on governments to describe the eventsas “genocide” will not yield results.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, exactly what unfolded in 1915, continues to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia that has proven to be a spoiler in relations between the two neighboring states.\n\nWhile Armenia and the Armenian diaspora claim that nothing short of “genocide” occurred at the hands of Ottoman authorities under a relocation order of some ethnic Armenians, Turkey says Turks and Armenians died during clashes between Ottoman forces and armed Armenian gangs backed by Russia.\n\nSince, Armenia is trying to put pressure on other governments to describe the events as “genocide” and do not back the idea of looking into the archives as the Turkish government has been suggesting for almost two years.\n\nProfessor Christopher Gunn from Coastal Carolina University, whose studies focus on the Ottoman history, told Anadolu Agency that Armenia is not at a point to change its approach to the issue and was not interested in “true reconciliation\".\n\n“Nothing positive will come out of pressuring governments to legislate the history,” Gunn said, adding that history should be the business of historians and not foreign legislation.\n\n“If Armenia is interested in reconciliation and resolution of the issue, they need to come to the table and be willing to discuss and debate with Turkey, Turkish academics, etc.\"\n\nAccording to Edward Erickson, a professor of military history at the Command & Staff College at the Marine Corps University and author of Ottomans and Armenians: A Study in Counterinsurgency, the recognition of the events of1915 by other countries as “genocide” only advantaged the Armenian diaspora, “many of whom desire financial compensation and property restitution.\n\n“The country of Armenia, in my view, derives no advantage from such recognition,” he said. “The main problem between Turkey and Armenia is Nagorno-Karabakh. The 1915 events are only a distraction for the country of Armenia.”\n\nArmenian militia has occupied the Azerbaijan’s Karabakh region since 1993, similar to pro-Russian militia that have illegally occupied parts of Ukraine since 2014. Turkey stands by Azerbaijan -- whose people are ethnically Turkic.\n\nErickson added that every scholar working on the issue knew that the Turkish national and military archives were already open and that the Armenian national archives were closed.\n\nProfessor Justin McCarthy from Louisville University described Armenia’s efforts to put other governments under pressure as a “terrible mistake” and that this approach was partly “pretty political.\n\n“Armenian organizations feel that they have to do that to keep their people together but partly they hope that the EU would force to Turkey to do something,” he said.\n\n“But that’s not going to happen … I think ultimately they have to fail.”\n\nHe also stressed that Armenia should “start to act like a responsible party” and leave at least most of the land they have taken from Azerbaijan, referring to Karabakh.\n\n“If they do that then Turkey can open the borders and they can trade with Armenia. Armenia really needs that,” he added.\n\nPolitical Science professor Michael Gunther, from Tennessee Technological University and author of two academic books and scholarly articles on the Armenian issue, noted that Armenians and their supporters continue to benefit from the impression that only they have suffered from the 1915 events.\n\n“So why should the Armenians compromise on this issue despite the conciliatory statements by then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made in 2014,” he said.\n\nGunther added that the reason why Armenia continued to place pressure on other governments and “indeed” escaped the calls for any dialogue was that benefit.\n\nThe Turkish government has been telling the international community since 2014 that Turkish national and military archives about the 1915 events were ready to be opened.\n\nPresident Barack Obama had described the events of 1915 involving Armenians within the Ottoman Empire as \"Meds Yeghern,\" an Armenian term meaning \"great calamity\". He once more refrained, as in previous years, from describing the events as \"genocide\", which he did during his first presidential campaign.\n\nEach year, worldwide rallies are staged by the Turkish people to reject Armenia's thesis. A ‘huge peace and solidarity walk’ will mark one of the biggest events this year on April 24 by the Turks, where thousands of supporters are expected to walk from the White House to the Turkish embassy in Washington DC.\n\nWhat happened in 1915?\n\nWorld War I was a global disaster that left 15 million people dead and another 20 million injured.\n\nThe empires of the Ottomans, Austria-Hungary and Russia collapsed and boundaries were remapped.\n\nMillions of people had to leave their homes -- a common fate for the people who formed the Ottoman Empire, including Armenians.\n\nDuring the war, some Armenian nationalists took advantage of the fact that the Ottoman and Russian forces were fighting each other and collaborated with the Russian army, with the aim of creating an ethnically homogenous Armenian homeland.\n\nWhen the Russian army invaded eastern Anatolia, some volunteer Armenian units in Russia and the Ottoman Empire supported the invasion.

      "content": "Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that U.S. President Barack Obama’s comment on the 1915 incidents represented a “one-sided interpretation of history”.\n\nPresident Obama described the events of 1915 involving Armenians within the Ottoman Empire as \"Meds Yeghern\", an Armenian term meaning \"great calamity\" in a statement released Friday.\n\nIn a written statement ,Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Obama’s statement was a new example of a one-sided history telling of the “pain suffered during the World War I”.\n\n“Turkey has shown the will to build a joint future with peace based on the shared living experience for centuries between Turkish and Armenian nations. It is sad that friend and ally countries encourage the circle that [aim] to deepen the conflict instead of answering [Turkey’s] call. It is obvious that the efforts to politicize the pain suffered in history do not do any good to anyone so far.”\n\n“While this is the situation, the circles that aim to profit from the positions that third-party countries would take on the different dates of the year not only harm the hope for friendship and peace but they also disrespect the pain suffered during those days.”\n\n“We invite the U.S. government to evaluate the historical facts based on a fair memory while taking into consideration the pain of all sides and adopt an objective, reasonable and constructive approach.” What happened in 1915? World War I was a global disaster that left 15 million people dead and another 20 million injured. The empires of the Ottomans, Austria-Hungary and Russia collapsed and boundaries were remapped. Millions of people had to leave their homes -- a common fate for the people who formed the Ottoman Empire, including Armenians. During the war, some Armenian nationalists took advantage of the fact that the Ottoman and Russian forces were fighting each other and collaborated with the Russian army, with the aim of creating an ethnically homogenous Armenian homeland. When the Russian army invaded eastern Anatolia, some volunteer Armenian units in Russia and the Ottoman Empire supported the invasion. Some Armenian officials in the Ottoman army switched sides and joined the invading Russian army against the Turks. Also, some Armenian armed groups massacred civilians during the Russian invasion. In response, the Ottoman government tried to convince Armenian representatives and opinion leaders to stop the violence, but result in favor came out of it. The government then decided to shut down the Armenian revolutionary committees and arrest or deport some well-known figures on April 24, 1915 -- a date that would later be selected to hold activities commemorating the so-called \"Armenian genocide.\" On May 27, 1915, the Ottoman government ordered the Armenian population residing in or near the war zone, as well as those collaborating with the Russian army, to be relocated to the southern Ottoman provinces. War-time conditions, famine, epidemics, ongoing internal conflicts and local groups seeking to take revenge, left a number of Armenians dead, although the Ottoman government had made careful plans for their safe transfer and tried to meet their humanitarian needs. Historical documents clearly show that the Ottoman government, not only did not intend for these tragedies to take place, but also punished offenders who committed crimes against the relocated Armenians. - Need for empathy and fair memory Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have demanded an apology and compensation for the 1915 incidents. They have also advocated for the recognition of the events as “genocide,” a term defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” Turkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as “genocide” and describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides. Turkey argues that the issue should be handled from a perspective of “just memory,” by respecting the “memory” of both sides, understanding what each nation experienced and taking a non-political, non-biased approach to history. The Turkish government has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from both countries that includes international experts in order to tackle the issue in a scientific manner. The commission is proposed to conduct its research, not only by using Turkish and Armenian archives, but also by using the relevant archives of other countries. - Armenia did not use opportunity to normalize relations The most significant development in the normalization of relations between the two countries was in October 2009, when two protocols were signed to rebuild diplomatic relations and improve bilateral relations. The protocols proposed an impartial scientific examination of the historical records and archives and the mutual recognition of boundaries in order to restore confidence between the two nations and find solutions to existing problems. The protocols also included cooperation in a wide range of areas including tourism, economy, transport, communication, energy, environment, high-level political consultations and student exchange programs, which could all help in normalizing relations. The Turkish government sent the protocols directly to parliament for approval, while the Armenian government submitted the protocols to the constitutional court, which ruled that they did not abide by the nature and wording of the country’s constitution. The constitution refers to the \"Armenian Declaration of Independence,\" in which an item reads: \"The Republic of Armenia stands in support of the task of achieving international recognition of the 1915 Genocide in Ottoman Turkey and Western Armenia.\" The declaration also names the eastern part of today's Turkey as \"Western Armenia.\" In January 2010, the Armenian government announced that it froze the approval process of the protocols. Five years later, the protocols were withdrawn from the Armenian parliament. Turkish authorities believe that in order to overcome the historical and political bitterness, all sides must be honest and open-minded.

      "content": "President Barack Obama described the events of 1915 involving Armenians within the Ottoman Empire as \"Meds Yeghern,\" an Armenian term meaning \"great calamity\" in a statement released Friday.\n\nIn using the term in his final months as the president, Obama again refrained, as he did in previous years, from describing the events as \"genocide\", which he did during his first presidential campaign.\n\n\"Today we solemnly reflect on the first mass atrocity of the 20th century -- the Armenian Meds Yeghern -- when one and a half million Armenian people were deported, massacred, and marched to their deaths in the final days of the Ottoman empire,\" Obama said.\n\nHe stated that the U.S. stood with the Armenian people throughout the world \"in recalling the horror of the Meds Yeghern\" and reaffirmed his country’s ongoing commitment to a \"democratic, peaceful, and prosperous Armenia.\n\n\"I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view has not changed,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president added that the U.S. continued to welcome the views of Turkish and Armenian historians and Pope Francis, \"who have sought to shed new light into the darkness of the past\".\n\nObama also expressed appreciation to Armenians for welcoming nearly 17,000 Syrian refugees into their country.\n\nExactly what unfolded in 1915 continues to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia that has proven a spoiler in relations between the two neighboring states.\n\nArmenia and the Armenian diaspora claim that nothing short of genocide occurred at the hands of Ottoman authorities under a relocation order of some ethnic Armenians. But Turkey says Turks and Armenians died during clashes between Ottoman forces and armed Armenian gangs backed by Russia.\n\nObama urged a \"full, frank, and just acknowledgement\" of the events, saying, \"peoples and nations grow stronger, and build a foundation for a more just and tolerant future, by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the past\".\n\nThe Turkish presidency has not responded to Obama’s statement.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan released a statement in nine languages last year, including Armenian, in which he offered condolences to the descendants of Armenians killed during World War I.\n\n- What happened in 1915?\n\nWorld War I was a global disaster that left 15 million people dead and another 20 million injured. The empires of the Ottomans, Austria-Hungary and Russia collapsed and boundaries were remapped. Millions of people had to leave their homes -- a common fate for the people who formed the Ottoman Empire, including Armenians.\n\nDuring the war, some Armenian nationalists took advantage of the fact that the Ottoman and Russian forces were fighting each other and collaborated with the Russian army, with the aim of creating an ethnically homogenous Armenian homeland.\n\nWhen the Russian army invaded eastern Anatolia, some volunteer Armenian units in Russia and the Ottoman Empire supported the invasion. Some Armenian officials in the Ottoman army switched sides and joined the invading Russian army against the Turks.\n\nAlso, some Armenian armed groups massacred civilians during the Russian invasion. In response, the Ottoman government tried to convince Armenian representatives and opinion leaders to stop the violence, but result in favor came out of it.\n\nThe government then decided to shut down the Armenian revolutionary committees and arrest or deport some well-known figures on April 24, 1915 -- a date that would later be selected to hold activities commemorating the so-called \"Armenian genocide.\"\n\nOn May 27, 1915, the Ottoman government ordered the Armenian population residing in or near the war zone, as well as those collaborating with the Russian army, to be relocated to the southern Ottoman provinces.\n\nWar-time conditions, famine, epidemics, ongoing internal conflicts and local groups seeking to take revenge, left a number of Armenians dead, although the Ottoman government had made careful plans for their safe transfer and tried to meet their humanitarian needs.\n\nHistorical documents clearly show that the Ottoman government, not only did not intend for these tragedies to take place, but also punished offenders who committed crimes against the relocated Armenians.\n\n- Need for empathy and fair memory\n\nArmenia and the Armenian diaspora have demanded an apology and compensation for the 1915 incidents.\n\nThey have also advocated for the recognition of the events as “genocide,” a term defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”\n\nTurkey objects to the presentation of the incidents as “genocide” and describes the 1915 events as a tragedy for both sides.\n\nTurkey argues that the issue should be handled from a perspective of “just memory,” by respecting the “memory” of both sides, understanding what each nation experienced and taking a non-political, non-biased approach to history.\n\nThe Turkish government has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from both countries that includes international experts in order to tackle the issue in a scientific manner.\n\nThe commission is proposed to conduct its research, not only by using Turkish and Armenian archives, but also by using the relevant archives of other countries.\n\n- Armenia did not use opportunity to normalize relations\n\nThe most significant development in the normalization of relations between the two countries was in October 2009, when two protocols were signed to rebuild diplomatic relations and improve bilateral relations.\n\nThe protocols proposed an impartial scientific examination of the historical records and archives and the mutual recognition of boundaries in order to restore confidence between the two nations and find solutions to existing problems.\n\nThe protocols also included cooperation in a wide range of areas including tourism, economy, transport, communication, energy, environment, high-level political consultations and student exchange programs, which could all help in normalizing relations.\n\nThe Turkish government sent the protocols directly to parliament for approval, while the Armenian government submitted the protocols to the constitutional court, which ruled that they did not abide by the nature and wording of the country’s constitution.\n\nThe constitution refers to the \"Armenian Declaration of Independence,\" in which an item reads: \"The Republic of Armenia stands in support of the task of achieving international recognition of the 1915 Genocide in Ottoman Turkey and Western Armenia.\"\n\nThe declaration also names the eastern part of today's Turkey as \"Western Armenia.\"\n\nIn January 2010, the Armenian government announced that it froze the approval process of the protocols. Five years later, the protocols were withdrawn from the Armenian parliament.\n\nTurkish authorities believe that in order to overcome the historical and political bitterness, all sides must be honest and open-minded.\n\nTurkey's then foreign minister and incumbent Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in December 2013, following his visit to Armenia, that one-sided approaches and conjectural evaluations should be avoided in order to find a solution. He added that history could only be built with a \"just memory.\"\n\nIn 2014, when incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was prime minister, he expressed his condolences for the first time to all Ottoman citizens who lost their lives during the 1915 events, including Armenians.\n\n\"I offered a hand of friendship in 2014 to Armenia, but, unfortunately, it came to nothing,\" Erdogan said in a recent speech.​",

      "content": "A music project meant to bring together musicians from Turkey and Armenia, two countries with rocky relations, has borne its first fruit in a song to promote peace.The Melody for Harmony project, sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Armenia, brought together musicians from both countries for concerts in Istanbul and Armenia’s capital, Yerevan, last December.Their English-language peace song, “Don’t Blame Me” was played at both concerts and has been posted to YouTube.English-language alternative rock band The Beautified Project – formed in London 2005 by singer/songwriter Andre Simonian – took part in the project from Armenia, while well-known Turkish musicians Goksel Baktagir, Yurdal Tokcan, Burak Malkoc, and Mert Elmas participated from Turkey.“Don’t Blame Me” was written and composed by Simonian, with classical Turkish and Western contributions from Baktagir.The four-minute-plus song begins with the lyrics, “Don’t blame me I’m innocent, I just happened to be in your way”.Turks and Armenians lived together for centuries in the Ottoman era until the mass deportations of 1915, which Armenia describes as “genocide”, a charge Turkey denies, saying that killings took place on both sides during World War I.Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Turkish-Armenian singer Sibil Pektorosoglu, a guest performer at both concerts, said the song is a synthesis of East and West.Pektorosoglu said she hopes that with the help of the universal power of music, the Melody for Harmony project will bring together musicians from other countries embroiled in political disputes.“We need the creative power of music. I hope that this project travels around the world and will not just end with the Istanbul and Yerevan concerts.”\n\nStressing the importance of having a concert in Yerevan, Pektorosoglu said Turkish musicians having a concert in Armenia is unusual, unlike Armenian musicians having a concert in Turkey, which is common.\n\n“If I am not mistake, this is the first time such a thing [concert] has happened [in Armenia],” she added.",

      "content": "It is a sunny Monday afternoon and Yetvart Danzikyan, the editor-in-chief of Turkey’s only Turkish-Armenian weekly Agos, is working in his office, surrounded by books on peace journalism and history.\n\nLocated in Istanbul’s teeming Sisli district, Agos – which means a slit in the ground to sow seeds or metaphorically to bring up a culture – was founded 20 years ago on April 5.\n\nThe newspaper was set up by a group of young Armenians including one Hrant Dink, who later became its editor.\n\nDink was later assassinated in front of his office by a teenage Turkish nationalist in 2007.\n\nAn important figure for the Armenian community in Turkey, Dink tried to open discussion on Turkey’s taboo topics and was an advocate of democratization and human rights.\n\nDink was repeatedly prosecuted for “denigrating Turkishness” over his articles about Armenian identity and mass deportations of Armenians in 1915.\n\nArmenia describes these as ‘genocide’, a description Turkey rejects.\n\nToday, Agos is located a couple of hundred meters away from its former site where Dink was gunned down in broad daylight.\n\nDanzikyan, who became editor in February last year, says that although leaving their former office was difficult, staying there was also hard.\n\n“Walking around that plaque … was a heavy feeling,” he says, referring to a small monument there which reads 'Hrant Dink was murdered here, January 19, 2007, at 15:05'.\n\nAlthough the paper has fully moved to its new home, an apartment which doubled as Dink’s office has been kept as it was. This is soon to be turned into a museum dedicated to the slain journalist, says Danzikyan whose study is decorated with a patchwork quilt embroidered with the Armenian alphabet.\n\nAgos’ new home is a three-story building, which long served as an Armenian school.\n\nThe school has had no students since the 1990s and was empty for more than 10 years, Danzikyan says.\n\nTurkey has a long history of Armenian publications which goes back to the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul has long been home to a number of minority newspapers.\n\nEven today the city houses perhaps the Armenian community’s longest-running daily paper – Jamanak – which has been going for more than 100 years. Another daily newspaper in the Armenian language is Marmara.\n\nThere are also magazines such as Paros and Luys, as well as a publishing house called Aras mainly working on Armenian literature and culture.\n\nToday Agos is located on the second floor of a modern building and was designed as a cultural center. It boasts a conference hall and a library under the umbrella of the Hrant Dink Foundation.\n\nAs Agos celebrates its 20th anniversary, conferences and panel discussions on Armenian matters are planned for the whole year, says Danzikyan.\n\nThe 47-year-old journalist, who was also part of the founding team of the paper, worked as a columnist for Agos since 2008. He has also worked in Turkey’s mainstream media.\n\nWith 18 staff and a weekly circulation of 4,000, Agos is a small but influential newspaper, especially on minority issues in Turkey.\n\nFor Agos Tuesdays and Wednesdays are when the staff design the latest edition and its journalists stay up late to see the paper put to bed, a tradition which has continued for the last 20 years, says Danzikyan.\n\nRevenue comes from sales, advertising and subscriptions; the Turkish government has also provided funding to Agos in the past.\n\nThe bilingual newspaper also has a fast-growing website, which publishes in Turkish and Armenian but has included English in the last two years.\n\nIstanbul Armenians speak a different dialect of the language, which is called Western Armenian. Agos’ main languages are Turkish and Western Armenian but several news stories are translated into Eastern Armenian every week.\n\nAgos’ readers are generally the Armenian community and other minorities in Turkey as well as people interested in the country’s democratization process, Danzikyan says.\n\nSince its foundation, the newspaper has focused on Turkish politics as well as issues for the Armenian community and other minorities such as Kurds, Greeks or Jews.\n\n“After the assassination of Hrant Dink [we mostly] follow the [murder] case,” he says.\n\nSupporting developments intended for a solution to Kurdish issues is another focus for Agos, Danzikyan says.\n\n“We know that when the Kurdish matter is solved, everyone in Turkey will live better,” he adds.\n\nThe paper has readers in Turkey’s biggest cities – Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir – as well as in the south-east but getting the publication to subscribers is one of Agos’ biggest problems.\n\n“We cannot deliver it everywhere,” Danzikyan says, explaining how they struggle with delivery and trying to send some issues by post, as “delivery companies demand a lot of money and high circulation numbers”.\n\nMost of their readers outside of Turkey are in France and the U.S. as these countries are home to large Armenian communities.\n\nDink had a big impact on the young generation both with his life and the feelings that built after his death, Danzikyan says.\n\n“There is this huge reality of the Hrant Dink murder in our lives; this reality has also affected Agos’ life,” he adds.\n\n“Getting a fair [court] decision is very important for Agos,” he says.\n\nThere are several ongoing legal cases into Dink’s murder. High-profile figures were questioned as part of the investigation, including a former Istanbul vice-governor and a former police chief.\n\nDink’s murder also energized young people of Armenian heritage in Turkey.\n\n“They are speaking braver,” Danzikyan says, adding he could not imagine this 20 years ago.\n\nAccording to Danzikyan, there is still some prejudice against Agos:\n\n“We always got stress every time nationalism increased [in Turkey]; some emails or offensive discourse via social media begin.”\n\nDespite the difficulties, Agos wants to be more active on the Internet and to become the voice of more and more people.\n\nPromoting the Western Armenian language is another issue, as the dialect has been spoken less and less over the last 100 years.\n\n“Western Armenian had been spoken in Istanbul, Syria and Lebanon,” Danzikyan says, adding that because of the Syrian war, one center of the language has been already lost.\n\n“It is not difficult to understand why [the language is not known by a younger generation] as people do not speak Western Armenian. There is no television channel or radio; they do not hear a song in the Western Armenian language.”\n\nThe last 20 years have seen turbulent times for this little newspaper, but the next two decades – with ever-improving technology – could see it extend its reach.\n\n“We think that a radio station would be good,” Danzikyan adds.",

Perincek was tried by the Lausanne Police Court in March 2007, found guilty of racial discrimination, and fined.\n\nA Swiss Appeals Court subsequently confirmed Perincek's sentence. Perincek then appealed to the Federal Tribunal, the highest court in Switzerland, which also confirmed the sentence.\n\nIn 2008, Perincek appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, claiming that the Swiss courts had violated his rights, including that to freedom of expression.\n\nMany Armenians argue that denying allegations that the events of 1915 constituted \"genocide\" should be a crime, just as negating the Holocaust is. In 2003, the National Council of Switzerland, the country's parliament, recognized the events of 1915 as \"genocide.\"\n\nThe 1915 events occurred during World War I when a part of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire sided with the invading Russians and revolted.\n\nThe relocation of Armenians by the Ottomans in eastern Anatolia following the revolts resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nTurkey does not dispute that there were casualties on both sides, but rejects calling the events “genocide.” Instead, it calls for a joint commission of historians to be established and archives to be opened in order to study and uncover what happened between the Ottoman Empire and its Armenian citizens.",

However he stressed again that dealing with the terrorist threat from groups in Syria has become more difficult due to delayed intervention in Syria.\n\nAtalay said, “It's easy to have a table talk on Syria in Washington however we have a thousand km long border, relatives live on both sides. It's impossible for them to hear, understand and live the difficulties we are going through.”\n\nHe again stressed that the Syria opposition was not supported by the international community. He added, \"The United States and the West continue their sensitivity regarding organizations like Al-Qaeda while we are telling them that you are the reason for their emergence.\"\n\nAtalay said Johnson accepted his invitation to visit Turkey and the Syrian refugee camps on Turkey's border. He added that Turkey has opened its doors to more than one million Syrian refugees - 230 thousand of these are in camps on the border. Turkey has spent more than $3 billion on these refugees so far, but \"has not seen any assistance from the international community in this regard\" said Atalay.\n\nAtalay said that he discussed bilateral cooperation in security and fight against terrorism in his meeting with Assistant National Security Adviser Tony Blinken and drew attention to Armenian resolutions discussed at Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate and 5-6 resolutions regarding Turkey brought to U.S. Congress.\n\nReplying a question whether Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's latest statement regarding the 1915 incidents was discussed during his contacts Atalay said, “The statement of the Prime Minister regarding the Armenian issue was the most advanced step. We always intended to solve this problem. We have always said that this kind of advanced steps must be taken, historians should work, let's open all archives and solve the problems.\n\nNeither U.S. President nor the White House has referred to Prime Minister Erdogan's statement. They pretended that they did but actually they didn't because it was mere a comment made by the U.S. State Department Spokesperson. Now they say that they will make a statement.\"\n\nCriticizing supply of Apache helicopters to Egypt Atalay said, “God willing the Egyptian government steps back on death penalties while many people have already been killed in peaceful demonstrations in Egypt however the United States and West have displayed contradiction in this regard and failed to put forward a clear stance against the coup.”\n\nAtalay said Turkey has done its part as a NATO member however Turkey has different relations with Russia because of Crimea and the situation of Crimean Tatars is very important for Turkey.\n\n\"Erdogan has expressed his condolences over the Armenian people who lost their lives. But again Armenia did not reply positively.”\n\nThe details behind the incidents in 1915 continue to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia which has kept relations sour between the two neighbors.\n\nThe 1915 incidents took place during World War I when a portion of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire sided with the invading Russians and uprose against the Ottoman authority. The uprisings were followed by a relocation decision of the Ottoman Empire concerning Armenians living in eastern Anatolia.\n\nTurkey says that both Turks and Armenians died during clashes between Ottoman forces and armed Armenian groups backed by Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan’s message has been well received by Armenians living in Turkey’s southeastern region.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

The move attracted worldwide media reaction.\n\nThe incidents of 1915 took place during World War I, when a portion of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire sided with invading Russians and rose up against governing Ottoman rulers, followed by a decision by the Ottoman-era officials to relocate Armenians living in eastern Anatolia. An unknown number of people died amid civil war.\n\nNo country could escape from the “smear campaign” of Armenian diaspora if their parliaments keep one eye on the domestic policy, Cicek said after meeting with the president of the Romanian House of Representatives, Valeriu Stefan Zgonea.\n\n“We have asked the Romanian Parliament to be sensitive about this issue,” Cicek added.\n\nThe Armenian diaspora and the state of Armenia describe the incidents of 1915 as 'genocide' and ask for compensation, while Turkey says that even though Armenians died during the relocation, many Turks also died due to attacks by Armenian gangs all across Anatolia.\n\nExactly what unfolded in 1915 continues to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia, and remains a spoiler in relations between the two neighboring countries.\n\nDescribing Erdogan’s statement regarding the 1915 incidents as a “perfect stance,” Zgonea said the statement was a positive policy.\n\n“Romania didn’t issue any formal statement on the 1915 incidents. We agree on the idea that the incidents should be dealt by historians,” Zgonea said. He pointed out that relations between Turkey and Romania are not superficial but pragmatic.\n\nZgonea said Romania’s Turkish minority have been promised allocations to establish a mosque in Bucharest, Romania's capital.\n\n“We will soon release the location of the mosque and hope to build a social and cultural center in Istanbul,” Zgonea told Cicek during the meeting.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

Its efforts to bring broader political rights, education in mother tongue languages such as Kurdish and tougher penalties for hate speech were seen in last September's \"democratization package.\"\n\nPart of this package ruled on the return of property and artefacts to the Christian minorities. Turkey returned part of the land to the historic Mor Gabriel Monastery - the oldest surviving Syriac Orthodox monastery in the world - in Turkey’s southeast region in March.\n\nMahcupyan says the AK Party is pursuing the formation of a new societal ideology in Turkey. He said the AK Party’s efforts will result in a new way of living together without \"religious or ethnic hierarchy.”\n\nArtur Ghazinyan, an expert on human rights and democratization at the Armenia-based, Centre for European Studies, told AA the statement was a \"necessary step\" to be taken before the centennial anniversary due next year of the 1915 incidents.\n\nGhazinyan says Erdogan's comments apparently show that  the Turkish authorities have initiated a process that would create an image that Turkey has changed her attitude towards this problem.\n\nHowever, Ghazinyan says a lot more needs to be done. Instead of historians working on the incident, Ghazinyan suggests  “a committee of international law experts” and also a “UN criminal tribunal, who would work together to develop the international legal qualification of the 1915 acts.”\n\nGhazinyan says this is necessary \"if the Turkish government and people are willing to face up to their violent and tragic history and reconcile their relations with the Armenian diaspora.\"\n\nThe government should also go further he suggests by ending the closure of the border and establishing diplomatic and trade relations with Armenia.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

      "content": "Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s condolences to Armenians ahead of the anniversary of the 1915 incidents is a welcome gesture that falls short of dealing with the historical problem, an Armenian political analyst said Friday.\n\nRichard Giragosian, the director of the Armenia-based think-tank Regional Studies Centre, labelled Erdogan’s statement as \"an unprecedented gesture” from the Turkish side.\n\n“I would argue that the statement was both unexpected and unprecedented. Therefore it was a welcome gesture from the Turkish side,” Giragosian said in an exclusive interview with the Anadolu Agency.\n\nHowever, he added that Armenia and its diaspora saw the statement as not going fast or far enough in terms of dealing with the 1915 incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan released a statement in nine languages, including Armenian, in which he termed the events of 1915 as “inhumane” and offered condolences to the Armenians. The move attracted worldwide media reaction.\n\nEvents dubbed as 'the 1915 incidents' took place during the World War I, when a portion of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire sided with invading Russians and rose up against the Ottoman authority. The uprisings were followed by a decision by the Ottoman-era officials to relocate the Armenians living in eastern Anatolia.\n\nAs a result, an unknown number of people died amid civil strife.\n\nPointing out that there is a natural difference between Armenian diaspora and the Republic of Armenia, Giragosian said: “As a neighboring country, Armenia seeks open borders and diplomatic relations with Turkey, which is a different state level agenda than the diaspora whose perspective and the identity was shaped by the incidents of 1915 as is mine.”\n\nGiragosian, who was a member of the U.S.-based Armenian diaspora and later moved to Armenia, said the fact that he lives in Armenia changed his perspective to embrace the need for trade, open borders and diplomatic relations.\n\n“The lack of an open border between the two countries has resulted in an opening of minds,” he said.\n\nGiragosian - who played an important role in the “normalization” efforts between Turkey and Armenia - was in Istanbul on April 24 to take part in a commemoration of the 1915 incidents. The American-born political analyst is still very much engaged with the process, conducting meetings with officials and NGOs from both sides.\n\nHe said the Turkey had become much more confident and much more secure within years and it is something related to economic deveopment as much as political leadership.\n\n“At the same time what is interesting is that a revolution is going on in Turkey as serious and profound as Ataturk’s revolution,” he said.\n\nHe said Erdogan’s statement on the 1915 incidents represented a bold step forward in terms of the way Turkey deals with the issue.\n\nDespite the suspension of the normalization process between Turkey and Armenia, a “great deal” has already been achieved, Giragosian said.\n\nEven though the normalization process has not achieved its goal of opening the border and establishing true diplomatic relations, Giragosian said: \"There is increased contact where both Turks and Armenians getting to know each other once again, embracing the shared history - even the painful elements.\"\n\n“I am optimistic about the future, because both sides have gone too far to go backwards.”\n\nThe Armenian diaspora and the state of Armenia term the 1915 incidents as \"genocide\" and ask for compensation, whereas Turkey says that, while Armenians died during the relocation, many Turks also died due to the attacks by Armenian gangs all across Anatolia.\n\nExactly what unfolded in 1915 continues to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia that has proven a spoiler in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nGiragosian said the question of whether Turkish and Armenian peoples are ready for a normalization still remains unclear.\n\n“In this case what we need is leadership and statesmanship from both sides to lead people and to shape public opinion.”\n\nHowever, he added: “At the same time public opinion is quite willing to actually move beyond the old debates and rhetoric. I think people on the both sides of the close borders have overcome the past and are looking for new openings.\"\n\nAccording to Giragosian, there are three different target audiences of Erdogan's statement: the Armenian diaspora, the State of Armenia and the Turkish society.\n\n“I do see this as a new style for Prime Minister Erdogan. Much more presidential, much more Gul style in terms of larger humanistic ideas.”\n\nHe suggested that the first concrete steps to be taken in the future should focus on how to establish diplomatic relations immediately and how to open the border.\n\nHowever, he said the ultimate solution would not be reached before the 100th anniversary of the 1915 events and general elections in Turkey due in the same year.\n\n“What we should expect and demand are much more practical small steps to create the environment for such an outcome,” he said.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

      "content": "Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s statement to mark the 99th anniversary of the 1915's tragic incidents on Wednesday is welcomed by Turkey’s Armenian intellectuals.\n\nErdogan stressed the “common pain” endured during those events and expressed “condolences” to Armenians around the world and said that \"Armenians who lost their lives in the events in the early twentieth century rest in peace, and we convey our condolences to their grandchildren.\"\n\nThe prime minister's words were the first from a top official of the Turkish government to sympathize with the Armenians and have been welcomed by the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey. He said they are glad to receive his condolences to the descendant’s of Armenians who lost their lives in the events of 1915, according to a statement released by the General Vicar on Thursday.\n\nEtyen Mahcupyan, from Zaman daily told The Anadolu Agency (AA) that \"the new discourse initiated by Erdogan will certainly lead to normalization of ties with Armenia, because the discourse contains a normalization process in itself.”\n\nJen Psaki, the spokeswoman of the U.S. State Department said, “We welcome Prime Minister Erdogan's historic public acknowledgement of the suffering that Armenians experienced in 1915,” and she added,  “We believe this is a positive indication that there can be a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts, which we hope will advance the cause of reconciliation between Turks and Armenians.”\n\nThe statement also referred to the need for research into the 1915 events where in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, the campaign to forcibly relocate 1.5 million Armenians, who sided with the Russian invaders at the time, ended up with the death of thousands of Armenians. The statement urged for research to be carried out by a commission of Turkish, Armenian and international historians.\n\nThe Turkish opposition and some Armenian communities criticized Erdogan claiming the timing of the statement is opportunistic to allow pressure to be taken off the government before the 100th anniversary of 1915 events next year.\n\nHowever, Mahcupyan said, regarding this criticism, “This is a discourse focusing on conjecture.., but it is fully compliant with AK Party’s main policy choices, as it seen in other identity issues, such as the Kurdish and Alevi issues in Turkey.”\n\nIn September last year, Erdogan announced a \"democratization package\" that brought broader political rights, education in mother tongue languages such as Kurdish and tougher penalties for hate speech. The Parliament passed a part of the omnibus law on March.\n\nMahcupyan claims that the AK Party is pursuing the formation of a new societal ideology in Turkey, and noted, “AK Party’s efforts will result in a new way of living together, a new nationalism, which takes multicultural Anatolian society as its base without a religious or ethnic hierarchy.”\n\nMahcupyan showcased the Kurdish peace process and the return of property and artefacts to the Christian minorities, most recently when Turkey returned part of land to the historic Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation, in Turkey’s southeast region in March, as an example of Erdogan’s current attitude towards other ethnic groups and the Armenian question. This outlook is part of the democratization package announced last September by Erdogan who covers broader rights on education in native languages, which was long-awaited by the Kurdish population.\n\nSome Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) lawmakers condemned Erdogan’s statement saying that it is a rehearsal before calling the 1915 as \"genocide\".\n\nMahcupyan said many people already using the \"g-word\" referring to 1915 events, and what Erdogan's statement will enable is the seeking of an objective definition within society-based discussions.”\n\nHayko Bagdat, also an Armenian journalist, said it is too early to decide if the statement is a 'realpolitik' decision or a sincere one, and the only viable test is both time and whether further steps will be taken to compensate past injustices, for example finding the murderer of journalist Hrant Dink.\n\nBagdat said, \"to turn Erdogan’s statement into something real is not only the responsibility of the state, but all of the players, including us ; the civil society, media, universities and others.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he deemed the statement, which the Armenian diaspora waited so long to hear, as \"definitely a positive step\" by changing the official stance on the issue.\n\n- The list of real properties returned back to Armenian foundations by the Turkish government\n\nBeykoz Armenian graveyard, returned back to Beykoz Surp Nigogayos Armenian Church Foundation.\n\nThe land which previously belonged to Kuzguncuk Surp Krikor Lusavoric Armenian Church has been returned.\n\nBeziyen Armenian School, has been recognized as the property of Kartal Surp Armenian Church Foudnation.\n\nPart of the Buyukdere Armenian Graveyard, previously belonging to Apotologic Armenians, is returned back to Buyukdere Surp Hıripsimyants Armenian Church Foudnation.\n\nAn old graveyard in Sariyer is returned back to Yenikoy Kud Dido Asdvadzadzni Armenian Church Foundation.\n\n42 thousand 259 square-meters of land is returned back to Yedikule Surp Pirgic Armenian Hospital Foundation.\n\nArmenian Catholic graveyard is returned back to Elmadag Surp Armenian Hospital Foundation.\n\nPrivate Yesilkoy Armenian Primary School is returned back to Yesilkoy Istepanos Armenian Church School and Graveyard foundation.\n\nBomonti Armenian Mihitaryan Primary School is returned back to Beyoglu Surp Gazar Armenian Catholic Mihitaryan School and Convent Foundation.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

The uprisings were followed by a relocation decision of the Ottoman Empire concerning Armenians living in eastern Anatolia.\n\nAs a result, an unknown number of people died amid civil strife.\n\n\"History isn't just black and white - a grey area is needed. Everyone needs to show virtue by sharing the pains of the past,\" Davutoglu said at a reception held in Ankara for Turkey's April 23 National Sovereignty and Children's Day.\n\n'Humanitarian attitude'\n\nDavutoglu said Turkey's move could be surprising to some, adding: \"However, everyone is aware of Turkey's humanitarian and universal attitude towards the pains of humanity.\"\n\nHe said Turkey and Armenia had wanted to hold talks concerning the 1915 events in 2009 when an accord was signed to normalize relations.\n\n\"Turkey sees all losses regardless of ethnicity and religion as the losses of humanity,\" he added.\n\nHe said Turkey did not make Wednesday's statement under pressure and it did not have a cyclical dimension.\n\n\"We call on Armenia not only to display a common and humanitarian attitude, but also to build a future together,\" he said. \"I am sure our call will not be left hanging in the air.\"\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

      "content": "Regardless of their ethnic or religious origins, we pay tribute, with compassion and respect, to all Ottoman citizens who lost their lives in the events of 1915, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said in a written statement.\n\nErdogan released the message on Wednesday ahead of the anniversary of the events of 1915, which led to an unknown number of people dying in civil strife after the Ottoman Empire approved a deportation law for Armenians in April 24 of that year.\n\nThe 1915 events took place during World War I when a portion of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire sided with the invading Russians and uprose against the Ottoman authority.

It should not deter reciprocal humane attitudes and the establishment of sympathy between the Turkish and Armenian people that incidents which had inhumane results, like the 1915 relocation, occured during the First World War when millions of people from all religions and nationalities lost their lives.\"\n\nWhat was experienced during the First World War is our mutual pain,\" said Erdogan.\n\nErdogan stated that Turkey was open to reconsidering its approach to the issue, and added: \"Some may perceive this climate of freedom in Turkey as an opportunity to express accusatory, offensive and even provocative assertions and allegations.\"\n\n\"Even so, if this will enable us to understand historical issues with their actual aspects and to transform resentment to friendship again, we will consider different discourses with empathy and tolerance and expect a similar attitude from all sides.\"\n\nErdogan also called for Turkish and Armenian societies not to derive enmity from history and create new antagonisms.\n\n\"The spirit of the age necessitates dialogue despite differences, understanding by heeding others, evaluating the means for compromise, denouncing hatred, and praising respect and tolerance.\"\n\n\"It is with this understanding that we have opened our archives to all researchers. Today, hundreds of thousands of documents in our archives are at the service of historians,\" he said.\n\nThe Armenian diaspora and the state of Armenia term the incidents as \"genocide\" and ask for compensation, whereas Turkey says that, while Armenians died during the deportation, many Turks also died due to the attacks by Armenian gangs all across Anatolia.\n\nTurkey open to academic research of 1915 events: PM\n\nTurkey calls for academic research of the 1915 events to be carried out by a commission of Turkish, Armenian and international historians, the Turkish Prime Ministry said in a written statement on Wednesday ahead of the aniversary of the events.\n\nErdogan released a message for the anniversary of 1915 events which began when the Ottoman Empire approved a deportation law in April 24, 1915 for Armenians, when they held an uprising, aided by the the invading Russian army, during the First World War. As a result, an unknown number of people died in civil strife.\n\n\"In Turkey, expressing different opinions and thoughts freely on the events of 1915 is the requirement of a pluralistic society as well as of a culture of democracy and modernity,\" said Erdogan in the statement released in Turkish, English and French.\n\nErdogan said that any conscientious, fair and humane approach to the Armenian issue is required to bring forth an understanding of all the suffering experienced during that period regardless of religion or ethnicity.\n\nErdogan stated that Turkey is open to consideration on its approach to this issue and added: \"Some may perceive this climate of freedom in Turkey as an opportunity to express accusatory, offensive and even provocative assertions and allegations. Even so, if this will enable us to understand historical issues with their actual aspects and to transform resentment to friendship again, we will consider different discourses with empathy and tolerance and expect a similar attitude from all sides.\"\n\nUS welcomes Turkish PM’s Armenia 1915 announcement\n\nThe U.S. has welcomed a recent statement by the Turkish Prime Minister in which he offered condolences to the descendants of Armenians killed during World War I.\n\n“We welcome Prime Minister Erdogan's historic public acknowledgement of the suffering that Armenians experienced in 1915,” said Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman. “We believe this is a positive indication that there can be a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts, which we hope will advance the cause of reconciliation between Turks and Armenians.”\n\nExactly what unfolded in 1915 continues to be a contentious issue between Turkey and Armenia that has proven a spoiler in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nArmenia and the Armenian diaspora claim that nothing short of \"genocide\" occurred at the hands of Ottoman authorities under a relocation order of a part of the ethnic Armenians in the then-empire. But Turkey says that both Turks and Armenians died during clashes between Ottoman forces and armed Armenian groups backed by Russia.\n\nEarlier Wednesday Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, released a statement in nine languages, including Armenian, in which he termed the events of 1915 as “inhumane.”\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

      "content": "U.S. President Barack Obama on his annual April 24 statement is expected to use the expression \"Meds Yeghern” meaning “Great Catastrophe” in the Armenian language to characterize the incidents of 1915.\n\nApril 24 is the date to mark the anniversary of the tragic incidents  by the Armenian diaspora. Turkey and Armenia will once again watch attentively what term the U.S. President Obama will use in his annual 24th April statement to commemorate the 1915 event.\n\nDuring his 2008 Presidential election campaign, Obama used the word “genocide” to characterize the incidents that caused heavy casualties for both Armenians and Turks. While conducting his presidential campaign, Obama also promised the Armenian diaspora that he would recognize the “genocide” if he was elected president. Despite his comments before taking office, Obama avoided using the 'g-word' in his annual April 24 statements while at the White House although he says his personal opinion has not changed on what occurred in 1915. Obama is expected to take the same line this year regarding the incidents.\n\n“I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view has not changed. A full, frank, and just acknowledgement of the facts is in all of our interests. Nations grow stronger by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the past, thereby building a foundation for a more just and tolerant future. We appreciate this lesson in the United States, as we strive to reconcile some of the darkest moments in our own history. We recognize those courageous Armenians and Turks who have already taken this path, and encourage more to do so, with the backing of their governments, and mine,” Obama cited in his statement last year.\n\nHistorically, despite Armenian diaspora's pressure on U.S. presidents to recognise 1915 incidents as genocide, no president apart from former president Ronald Reagan has used the term, causing pressure to be born on the U.S. Congress by Armenians.\n\nCongress members from California and New Jersey, which have high numbers of Armenian-Americans, show sensitivity to the incidents because of voter concerns. Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Robert Menendez, Democrat Congressmen Adam Schiff of California and Frank Pallone of New Jersey are leading figures at Congress who pay attention to the incidents.\n\nWith the influence of the Armenian diaspora, every year resolutions on the 1915 incidents are submitted to foreign relations committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nRecently, a draft resolution related to the issue passed the Senate's committee. However, due to the Easter holiday, the resolution will not be handled earlier than April 24 on the Senate floor. Although the resolution will stay on the list for debate until the end of the Congress' legislative year, the possibility of coming to the floor is quite low as it will no longer be 'meaningful' anymore.\n\nThere are no signs that Harry Reid, the Democrat Majority Leader in the U.S.  Senate, who is responsible for bringing the resolutions to the floor, will highlight the resolution on the agenda.\n\nA similar draft resolution passed the Foreign Relations Committee in the House of Representatives in 2010 but was not brought to the floor despite heavy pressure from the Turkish embassy in Washington and the Turkish community. The resolution was not brought to the Congress in the following three years, especially after the Arab awakening, when Turkish-Armenian relations entered their 'golden age' and the Republicans, who did not lean to Armenian resolutions, became dominant in the House of Representatives in the 2010 by-elections.\n\nA recent resolution emerged by the Armenian lobby after last year's Gezi Park incidents and Istanbul-based 17 December operations. As the resolution is not expected to come to the floor at the Senate and President Obama is likely to avoid using the 'g-word', the Armenian diaspora is now focusing on the centennial anniversary of the incidents.\n\nEven though the Armenian diaspora started piling on pressure and began intense lobbying, attention does not appear to be focused on 2014's resolution. In 2015 which sees the hundredth anniversary of the incidents, it is expected that the diaspora will try to convince Obama to use “genocide” in next year's April 24 statement, and to focus on Congress to pass a resolution on the 1915 incidents.\n\nThe critical question is whether Obama will keep his promise on recognizing the incidents as a “genocide” in his last two years of presidency. On the other hand, the Armenian diaspora is likely to continue to shape U.S. public opinion and congress members through its activities.\n\nIf the U.S. recognizes the 1915 incidents as “genocide”, one of the impacts on the cases in the U.S. courts will be the Armenians' rights to compensation from Turkey. As present, many cases in the U.S. have been dismissed as they are not consistent with U.S. federal foreign policy and are not constitutional if the U.S. does not recognize the incidents as \"genocide.\" Therefore, to move forward on these compensation cases, it is necessary for the U.S. government to recognise the Armenian genocide.\n\nTurkey, being a member of NATO, is an important ally of the U.S.  and is a key partner in the Middle East. Consistent with U.S. policy to date, the U.S. does not want to lose a partner like Turkey when dealing with the civil war in Syria, Iran’s nuclear policy and Ukraine. The Incirlik base in the south of Turkey is also a critical asset for the U.S. for regional operations. Apart from having strong and long-standing defense cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey, economic ties have visibly increased in recent years.  As a result of this, the U.S. is likely not to risk all aspects of its relationship with Turkey for the sake of debatable past between Turkey and Armenia.\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

      "content": "American historian Justin McCarthy says Armenian allegations of genocide in 1915 continue to make it difficult for Turks to tell their own history of the tragic period at the end of the World War I.\n\nMcCarthy said in an interview with AA reporter in Ankara on Wednesday that he was researching the suffering of Muslims in the war, but the allegations of genocide compelled him. \"I was trying to find out the population of Armenians in Anatolia before and after World War I. As a result, I found that a large number of Turks were killed. How were these Turks killed, as they were not involved in the war? Between 2.5 and three million Muslims were killed in the war. I had never thought about writing about the Armenians, but the issue chose me while I was working on the Muslim history.”\n\nMcCarthy says, \"The reason for the Armenians to sustain their claims after all those years is so simple. If you keep on teaching your children hatred, they will grow up with hatred and their hatred will also continue growing.” McCarthy said the Armenian diaspora believes that they benefit from their allegations; that they will be paid compensation and make territorial claims on the Turkish towns of Kars, Erzurum, Bitlis and Van.\n\nMcCarthy argues, \"Their claim is false, but they still believe it. Just as Americans of German and Irish origins call themselves American, the Armenian diaspora fear their next generations will forget their historical identity and identify themselves with the country where they live. Therefore they keep their allegations alive to bolster their integrity. They have never heard anything good about the Turks, therefore they think Turks are evil.\"\n\nMcCarthy said, \"Finally, Turks have started to assert their historical truths against the Armenian allegations, which they were not doing until twenty years ago. Turks have to work hard to remove these prejudices. These prejudices will not be removed quickly and easily, because the other side has been working to sustain these prejudices for a century. It would take a long time because a Christian won't believe a Muslim just as a Muslim won't believe a Christian so easily and that is quite natural.\"\n\nMcCarthy emphasized that despite such trends, the world is not united against Turks on this matter, because the European Court of Human Rights recently exonerated Dogu Perincek, leader of Turkey's Labor Party, for his words regarding the 1915 incidents. He describes that as a good change.\n\nMcCarthy said propaganda and new legislations could be seen in the international arena on the centennial of the 1915 incidents next year. \"Turks should be prepared to endure huge pressure. However, I think the situation will calm down afterwards, because the current situation cannot continue forever. 100 years is a long time. If you gather all of the Armenians from Armenia, France, England, America and all around the world and replaced them in their six claimed Anatolian provinces, the Muslim population would remain twice as large.”\n\nJustin McCarthy has authored books titled “The Muslims and Minorities: Population of the Ottoman Anatolia and End of the Empire\", \"Death and Exile: Ethnic Cleansing of the Ottoman Muslims\" and \"Population of the Ottoman Peoples and End of the Empire.”\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

Two sisters of Armenian descent had sought refuge in Hatay earlier that week.\n\nKapusuz also condemned the U.S. for its inaction in the face of thousands of photographs of torture victims in Syria, as well as the mass death sentence recently handed down in Egypt.\n\n“Turkey wants to offer a helping hand to the needy in the region and worldwide. Since June 2013, some circles want to see Turkey more isolated, dealing with its domestic issues like terrorism and not paying attention to Syria or Palestine. That’s why they target the [Kurdish] ‘peace process’ and our domestic peace. They would like to see interest rates going up, growth rate and export decreasing, and unemployment rising in Turkey,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey’s opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) also criticized the draft resolution, saying that Armenian allegations have the power to negatively affect relations between the U.S. and Turkey.\n\n\"The bill is one-sided and does not comply with the truths.

Imagine homes where Turkish movies capture the attention of the elderly, adults and children alike.  Imagine markets full of Turkish food, from biscuits to jams, olive oil, and stuffed vine leaves...You may think these locations are in Istanbul or Ankara. But, you would be wrong!\n\nHaving lived in Los Angeles for over a decade, I have heard Turkish music, such as Tarkan, Ibrahim Tatlises, and Ajda Pekkan's coming from the homes of Armenians in Southern California.\n\nWhen you enter ethnic Armenian markets in L.A, you can find Turkish cuisine locally made, such as sucuk (sausage) and lahmacun (Turkish pizza with a spicy meat filling). You can see how close Armenian culture is to that of Turkish, from the music and arts to cinema and to the cuisine itself.\n\nOn a personal level, some of my best friends in L.A. are Armenians. Whenever I visited the renowned Farmers Market close to Hollywood, I always visit Moishe's Restaurant which is operated by Mrs. Diroug and Movses Aroyan to enjoy grilled kebaps, stuffed grape leaves, spinach pie and, of course, baklava. Both Diroug and Movses always give a heartfelt and sincere welcome to me and my family. We are welcomed by them not just as customers buying lunch or dinner but as close friends.\n\nUncle Simon Karian, an Armenian who speaks Turkish fluently and an expert on auto repairs in southeast L.A., is another one of those close friends of mine. Uncle Simon always welcomes us to his store with a smiling face and a warm hand shake. He is as close to us as our actual uncle living in Eskisehir, Turkey. He is a good listener and a good advisor on life in general.\n\nTurks and Armenians get along very well on a personal level. Yet, when it comes to politics, relations are quite tense. Before touching on the reasons for the tense political relations, it would be a good idea to briefly remember how close the Turks and Armenians were during the Ottoman Empire era.\n\nFor over five centuries, Turks and Armenians lived side by side in different parts of the Ottoman Empire. There were inter-cultural marriages between them and thousands of children whose father or mother were either Turkish or Armenian and vice versa. Many Armenians served as either high level bureaucrats or senior diplomats, including ambassadors and foreign ministers within the Ottoman Empire. There was a significant number of Armenian musicians, painters and artists and hundreds of Armenian families were successful tradesmen and business owners within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nArmenians operated various foundations and associations, published newspapers in their native language and could perform their religious services in their own churches under the auspices of the Ottoman Empire. There was no problem in co-existence in the Ottoman era up until World War I when Russian troops invaded parts of eastern Anatolia and a certain number of nationalist Armenians joined Russian ranks against the Ottoman government. Many Armenian gangs burned villages and killed a large number of Muslim Turks. Due to the uprising by a considerable number of its citizens of Armenian origin, the Ottoman administration decided to relocate a part of the Armenian population to the southern regions. During the relocation and the ongoing civil war in Anatolia, a certain number of Armenians died due to famine, bad weather conditions, poverty and inter-communal strife. Once a very loyal part of the Ottoman Empire, a portion of the Armenians of eastern Anatolia rose up against their own government by taking the side of the invading Russian forces. According to Ottoman history, hundreds of Armenians allegedly died during the civil war in Anatolia but there was never an Ottoman order made to systematically exterminate the whole Armenian population of the empire. Since World War I, the Armenian diaspora claims that the events of the era constituted a “genocide”. This is a charge completely rejected by the Turkish government.\n\nThe Turkish government has called on all historians to study the Ottoman archives pertaining to the era in order to scientifically study what really happened then between the Ottoman government and its Armenian citizens. The Turks agree that there were certainly Armenian casualties during World War I. The debate on “genocide” and the differing opinions between the present day Turkish government and the Armenian diaspora along with the current administration in Yerevan still generates political tension between the Turks and Armenians. Turkey's official position against the “genocide” allegations is that they acknowledge that the past experiences were a great tragedy and that both parties suffered heavy casualties, but that it is impossible to define these incidents as “genocide”. Turkey also recognizes that during World War I, hundreds of Muslim Turks lost their lives also.\n\nThe other important issue that causes tension between Turkey and Armenia is with Armenia's lack of recognition of the border between the two countries. In 1991, the Armenian Parliament adopted a resolution refuting the validity of the Treaties of Kars and Gyumri (the Treaty of Alexandropol) which defined the border between the two countries in 1921.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic Research, “on August 10, 1920, the Armenians joined in signing the long-hoped-for Treaty of Sevres, which stipulated that the Ottoman government recognize the establishment of an independent Armenian state, with boundaries to be determined by U.S. President Wilson. This treaty was, however, signed only by the Ottoman government in Istanbul, while most Turks, and most of the country accepted the leadership of the Ankara government, led by Mustafa Kemal, who actively opposed the treaty and its provisions.”\n\nThe Armenian propagandists claim that the Sevres Agreement, which allowed for the establishment of an Armenian state in eastern Anatolia, is still legally in force, and use it to base their claims for the 'return' of 'Armenian lands'. Turkish and many other historians stress that this agreement was never put into force. It was superseded and replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne, which renders the previous Sevres agreement outlawed.\n\nThe third issue that strains relations between Turkey and Armenia as well as the Armenian diaspora is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh is a region in the west of Azerbaijan, where Armenians constitute the majority. In the 1980s, according to political scientist Yoko Hirose, the efforts of Armenians living in this region to unite with Armenia intensified, and consequently armed conflict broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Although this skirmish ended with a ceasefire in 1994, Armenia still occupies twenty percent of Azerbaijan's territories in spite of decisions made by international law and the United Nations General Assembly. The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan badly influenced Turkey-Armenia relations and eventually led to the closure of the common border between the two countries. Turkey's expectations regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh problem is that Armenia should obey international law and stop occupying Azerbaijani territories.\n\nHowever, history cannot be changed and casualties on the Turkish and Armenian sides during World War I cannot be reversed. Painful memories from both sides from that era onwards still linger. However, hope remains that the border recognition and the Nagorno-Karabakh issue may be resolved through tools of diplomacy; dialogue, mutual trust and sincerity.\n\nIf Turks and Armenians can be good friends in different parts of the world ranging from L.A. to Sydney or from Paris to Istanbul, at a personal level, is it therefore possible that the Ankara and Yerevan governments could also? Anadolu Agency (AA) asked various experts about how the Turks and Armenians and their respective governments can jointly shape the future and reactivate the strong bonds that were once part of their relations both in Anatolia and elsewhere within Ottoman society.\n\nWith regards to the relocation of Armenians during World War I, Chairman of the Center for Eurasian Studies (AVIM) based in Ankara, retired ambassador Alev Kilic stressed that “war-time conditions, exacerbated by internal strife; local groups seeking revenge; banditry; famine; epidemics and the general lawlessness of a collapsing (Ottoman) state all combined to produce a painful tragedy that was beyond any contingency expectation.”\n\n“Officials/civilians who disobeyed the instructions of the Ottoman government to carry out the relocation in an orderly and secure way were court-martialed and those found guilty were sentenced to capital punishment by the government in 1916, long before the end of the First World War,” Kilic noted.\n\n“Insisting on 'genocide' as the only way to describe the Armenian experience, while ignoring Turkish losses, is not a proper way to honor the memory of those who lost their lives, nor does it correctly reflect the historical record,” Kilic underlined.\n\nIf the Armenian government and the Armenian diaspora give up the allegations of “genocide”, this can pave the way for better relations between the Turks and Armenians, Kilic stated.\n\n“Turks and Armenians should work to rebuild their historical friendship without forgetting the difficult periods in their past. It needs to be remembered that, despite the events of World War I, until the Armenian assassination (of Turkish diplomats and their family members) and the PR campaigns that began in the early 1970s, Armenians and Turks were very close to each other on a social level, and they still are today in some expatriate communities,” Kilic indicated.\n\n“Individual Turks and Armenians share a common Anatolian and Ottoman heritage and most aspects of its culture, even language. This may be the reason why today's Armenian radical opponents of Turkey insist on not having contacts of any sort with Turks or Turkey: they are trying to sever this heritage of mutual acceptance and shared heritage,” Kilic pointed out.\n\n“In the endeavor to overcome historical and political bitterness, all sides must be honest and open-minded,” Kilic emphasized.\n\n“A process of true dialogue, learning to respect the other side's truths, gradually building up respect through familiarity and empathy may well be possible. Could that not help Turkish and Armenian narratives come closer together around a “just memory”?  Believing that this is possible, Turkey proposed the establishment of a joint commission composed of Turkish and Armenian historians, and other international experts, to study the events of 1915 in the archives of Turkey, Armenia and in third countries (such as Great Britain and Russia). The findings of the commission might bring about a fuller and fairer understanding of this tragic period on both sides and hopefully contribute to normalization between Turks and Armenians,” Kilic said.\n\nAmbassador Kilic stressed that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in a 82-page ruling made on December 17, 2013 overturned a decision of a Lausanne court criminalizing the denial of the “Armenian genocide” underlying the fact that it is incorrect to describe the events of 1915 as an “Armenian genocide” and while only the parliaments of 20 countries out of a total of more than 200 countries, have adopted resolutions on the “genocide”, such resolutions were not adopted by the respective governments and could not be binding. According to Kilic, the ECHR also reminded that, while the Holocaust (of Jews) has been proven with documents and clear evidence, the allegations of an “Armenian genocide” cannot be evaluated in the same context as the Holocaust.\n\nThe ECHR stated that the Holocaust had no ties to the events of 1915 whatsoever, Kilic noted.\n\nKilic believes that the Turks and Armenians can re-establish strong, warm and friendly bonds in the near future as communities who have lived side by side for centuries.\n\n“I have had Armenian friends in various countries where I served. We just do not consider the Armenians as our 'enemy',” Kilic also said.\n\nKamer Kasim, Vice-President of the International Strategic Research Organization (USAK) based in Ankara, said that Turkey recognized the Armenian republic after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union but that normal relations could not be established with this state.\n\n“One of the reasons for the lack of normal relations between Turkey and Armenia has to do with the independent Armenian republic's foreign policy of trying to get the 'genocide' recognized internationally,” Kasim said.\n\n“The second reason for lack of normal relations between Turkey and Armenia has to do with Armenia's non-acceptance of Turkey's territorial integrity,” Kasim expressed.\n\n“And, the third reason is the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh,” Kasim noted.\n\n“Despite the first two reasons, the Turkish-Armenian border was open. However, after the continuation of Armenian occupation in Karabakh, Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993,” Kasim stated.\n\n“There were some attempts in the past to normalize relations between Turkey and Armenia such as the establishment of the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission,” Kasim said.\n\nNevertheless, some Armenian members of this Commission were threatened by the Armenian diaspora and the Commission was not able to reach concrete results, Kasim stressed.\n\nPast meetings between Turkish and Armenian journalists and academics with the goal to normalize relations failed as they could not make progress with the Yerevan government vis-a-vis the three reasons for tension in bilateral relations, Kasim pointed out.\n\nThe protocols signed between Turkey and Armenia in late 2009 were designed to restore diplomatic relations and create an opportunity to discuss their shared history. \"Turkey's proposal to establish a history commission in 2009 (to study the events of 1915) was not realized,\" Kasim noted.\n\n“While the Armenian Constitutional Court said that the signed protocols with Turkey were in conformity with the Armenian Constitution, the Court underlined that no Armenian administration could question the reality of the 'Armenian genocide',” Kasim said.\n\nSuch a Court decision handicapped the Yerevan government from joining a history commission proposed by Turkey to study the incidents of 1915, Kasim emphasized.\n\nKasim underlined that “in order for Turkey-Armenia relations to normalize, Armenian troops must withdraw from Karabakh.”\n\n\"Armenia must end occupying 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. It would not be realistic to expect Turkey to open its border with Armenia unless the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh ends. Furthermore, allegations of a genocide should no longer be Armenia's official state policy if normalized relations with Turkey are desired,\" Kasim remarked.\n\nHe stressed that with Armenian diaspora's stance on the issue and with the democratization of Armenia, a positive impact could be made on Armenian-Turkish relations by allowing the presentation of Turkey's arguments regarding the 1915 events to be brought to the fore for discussion.\n\nOnur Gokce, retired ambassador and a current lecturer at Bilkent University's International Relations Department, said that “As regards to what can be done to co-exist and build a common and promising future between Turkey and Armenia, my opinion would be to try to find effective ways to strengthen dialogue between the two countries and their respective peoples to start with.” “The Orthodox Church can and should play a role, since in essence, it mainly concerns the Armenian community,” Gokce noted.\n\n“Also, a way must be found to curb the ambitions of the Armenian Diaspora and their influence on Armenia and their lobbying activities in the USA and other important international spheres. This is the most difficult part because the issue has folded into becoming in time a matter of absolute survival for certain Armenian circles,” Gokce underlined.\n\n“To create common interests and benefits between the two countries would be helpful, particularly in the security and economic fields. Is history and religion a barrier to progress? It should not be, as evidenced by the Ottoman experience. However, the features and the realities of our contemporary times must be taken into consideration to be able to manage the new conditions that have emerged,” Gokce emphasized.\n\n“In any case, the red lines of each side would have to be crossed before a meaningful and lasting relationship can be established. But the issue has become multi-faceted and multi-dimensional. There are multiple players on stage,” Gokce stated.\n\n“Progress and normalization in bilateral relations does not depend only on the efforts of the two countries. The best way to deal with such a situation, in the meantime, would be to find ways to build confidence between the two countries and show, if possible, resistance in coordination against regional and outside interventions and above all be prepared to give concessions for the common interest of the two countries in the region. All said is a tall order. But, so is the issue,” Gokce also said.\n\nIt is clear that both Turkey and Armenia need to take confidence building measures (CBMs) to build a joint future and overcome challenges to the relations.\n\nTurkey has already taken significant CBMs to improve relations with Armenia such as granting 200 transit permit licenses for 2011 within the scope of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). These permits allow Armenian trucks to transport goods back and forth through Turkey between Armenia and third countries.\n\nTurkey has enabled the children of the Armenian citizens who reside illegally in Turkey to attend the minority schools in Turkey as guest students.\n\nTurkey has given permission to a private telecommunication company to establish direct fiber optic connection with Armenia.\n\nTurkey invited Armenian diplomats to attend the Turkish Foreign Ministry's diplomatic academy program for 2012. However, the Armenian side chose not to respond.\n\nTurkey has taken the necessary steps to list the city of Ani (a ruined Armenian medieval city located in Turkey), as Turkey's candidate to the World Heritage List. In this regard, the works to restore the Cathedral of Ani has been accelerated in recent years.\n\nTurkey has intensified its program toward restoration/renovation of Armenian churches in the country.\n\nTurkey continues to promote the cooperation among NGOs and labor unions and support the participation of its institutions in events organized in Armenia. The Civilitas Foundation, an Armenian NGO based in Yerevan, has announced last November the launch of its presence in Istanbul.\n\nTurkey has facilitated the return of or compensation for properties previously owned by religious community foundations.\n\nFinally, Turkey has kept its borders open to the Syrian Armenians who had to flee Syria due to conflicts, without any discrimination.\n\nIt is highly important that Armenia responds to Turkey's CBMs with its own CBMs to repair and carry forward relations. If Turks and Armenians can be good friends in different corners of the globe, so can the governments of Turkey and Armenia as two neighbors.\n\nAs a Turkish proverb goes, old friends can never be enemies...\n\nenglishnews@aa.com.tr",

However Assad continues killing people,\" he said. Replying to a question on relations between Turkey and Canada, Davutoglu said that Turkey was eager to have good and sound relations with Canada based on respect and dignity. \"We signed a protocol with Armenia and we announced that we are ready to discuss all historical events. I hope that one day the relations between Turkey and Armenia would reach a perfect level and Turks and Armenians would be good friends. We have very good relations with Canada as well,\" he said.Answering another question on Turkey-EU relations, Davutoglu said that Turkey was a key country, not a burden for the EU. Turkey was a country which can find solutions to all problems of the EU especially economic crisis, he said. In 2011, 2 million Europeans lost their jobs, but in Turkey 2 million people were employed in the same year, he added.\n\nFM Davutoglu inaugurates Monument for Martyred Turkish Diplomats in Canada\n\nOTTAWA (AA) - September 21, 2012 - Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Thursday said that the Turkish nation will never forget its diplomats assassinated by Armenian terrorists while on duty.Davutoglu inaugurated a Monument for Martyred Turkish Diplomats and the late Turkish Military Attache Colonel Atilla Altikat who was killed by the Armenian terror organization ASALA in 1982 in Ottowa.Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird was also present during the inauguration of the monument.Speaking at the monument, Davutoglu said that the monument was made in memory of all Turkish diplomats who became victims of terror.\"During the days the monument was getting completed, the U.S. Ambassador in Tripoli lost his life. August 27, the day when Colonel Altikat was assassinated, is a day when the Canadian nation met with international terror for the first time,\" Davutoglu stressed.\"This monument here is one that condemns terror. We thank all those who made this monument possible,\" Davutoglu said.Addressing Colonel Altikat's spouse Ayla Altikat and children Goker and Zeynep, Davutoglu said he wished his deep condolences to the Altikat family.\"I do hope that God's mercy is with Colonel Altikat. Martyrs never die in our culture. I am sure that Colonel Altikat's spirit is with us. I would like to thank you for letting us share your pain. On behalf of the Turkish nation, I would like to thank you for your strong posture throughout the years. Our martyrs, who have lost lives in different corners of the world, will never be forgotten,\" Davutoglu underlined.Minister Baird, in his part, said that the assassination of Colonel Atilla Altikat was a very sad incident.The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) is an Armenian terrorist organization which killed 46 Turkish citizens and other nationals, including Turkish diplomats and their family members, since the mid-1970s. The stated intention of ASALA was \"to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge publicly its responsibility for the incidents in 1915, pay reparations, and cede territory for an Armenian homeland\".\n\n-Memorial at Turkish Embassy-\n\nProceeding to the Turkish Embassy following the inauguration of the monument, Ahmet Davutoglu attended a memorial to remember Colonel Altikat.The memorial began with the Turkish national anthem. Verses from the Holy Koran were read and prayers made for all martyrs of Turkey.Davutoglu had a chance to speak with representatives of the Turkish community in Canada at the Turkish Embassy.Following the memorial, Davutoglu met with his Canadian counterpart Baird over a working meal.Davutoglu and Baird discussed the issues of Syria and Iran and took a decision to boost bilateral relations, including commercial ones.Davutoglu and his delegation later proceeded to New York from Canada.",

      "content": "International relations experts of France are hopeful and optimistic about reactivation of better bilateral relations during Hollande's presidency.\n\nBilateral relations of France had came to a standstill during Nicolas Sarkozy presidency. French experts are optimistic about France's being positive over Turkey-EU relations, however they foresee that Armenian allegations regarding incidents in 1915 will continue for a while. Didier Billion who works as a researcher at Institute for International and Strategic Relations (IRIS) said that he believed during President Francois Hollande's era the bilateral relations between France and Turkey would get calmer and better. Billion replied the question of AA related to the subject and said that the Hollande and his government would consider following the normalizing and reforming policies in order to improve the bilateral relations of France. Billion said, \"At least, Hollande is not against Turkey's membership to the EU from the intellectual point of view. I guess that chapters that were prevented by Sarkozy will open in Holland's period. Billion also stressed that the Armenia issue between Turkey and France will continue being a problem.\"Dorethy Schmidth who is a researcher at French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) said that the political atmosphere would be calmer in future. French researcher underlined, \"Hollande might annoy Turkey about the southeastern issue, women's rights and intellectual freedom. Opposite to Sarkozy, Hollande will not be against Turkey's membership to EU because of cultural differences or so. However, Hollande might bring forward the issue of democracy, might criticize Turkey's politics over Israel and Iran.\"Schmidth also highlighted that both countries should keep having close relationship over international issues such as Syria issue. Schmidth warned that the Armenia issue would not be off the agenda. Schmidth said that Hollande might try and work on finding social and diplomatic consensus. (Reporting by Rahmi Gunduz)",

It will chair the committee until May 2011.\nThe Turkish minister said Turkey did not pursue a policy based on sects, adding, \"we only want to contribute to regional and global peace.\"\nDavutoglu referred to turmoil in several Arab countries, and underlined importance of recent developments for expectations of regional people.\nThe minister said people in that region wanted more democracy, human rights, state of law and transparency, and highlighted importance of COE's experiences for regional rights.\nDavutoglu said demands of regional people were similar to COE's principles, and the council's experiences could be beneficial.\nThe COE is determined to share its experiences with those countries, Davutoglu said.\nDavutoglu said the council was willing to develop a relationship with those countries based on confidence, and the opportunity that had emerged to boost relations with regional countries should be seized.\nThe Turkish minister said COE member countries were facing a mass migration threat from those countries, and the council would work to respect human rights of those immigrants and protect legitimate rights of member countries.\nDavutoglu touched on Committee of Ministers meeting to take place in Istanbul in May, and said the committee would open a convention against domestic violence and violence against women to signature in that meeting.\nThe minister said he was expecting all member countries to sign that convention, and fight against intolerance and protection of rights of the Roma would also be discussed in the meeting.\nFight against discrimination and intolerance was one of the main principles of the Council of Europe, Davutoglu said.\nDavutoglu expressed concern over the developments in Belarus, Albania, Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and briefed PACE on the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers.\nThe minister also said isolation of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was against international law, and did not have any political or legal ground.\n\"TRNC people, who supported the UN plan, have been facing discrimination, and the international community is guilty,\" he said.\nDavutoglu said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was debating Upper Karabakh dispute, and Turkey had objected to occupation of Upper Karabakh and tried to draw the attention of the entire world to that tragedy.\nMoreover, Davutoglu said Turkey had proposed to set up a joint committee of historians to deal with the incidents of 1915, however it could not get any response from Armenia.\n\"Historical incidents should be examined jointly, and we should set up a joint committee instead of accusing us.

      "content": "Egemen Bagis met Turkish journalists in Paris after his meeting with French Interior Minister Claude Gueant on Thursday.\nBagis said, after meeting several high ranking French officials, that the French government was strongly against an Armenian legislation at the French Senate.\nThe French government has assured Turkey that they will warn socialists vis-a-vis the Armenian legislation, Bagis said.\nBagis said the draft Armenian legislation at the French Senate was completely against the freedom of expression in Europe.\nBagis described the members of the Armenian diaspora trying to pass such legislation as nothing but \"merchants of hatred\".\nTouching on his meeting with French Interior Minister Gueant on Thursday, Bagis said that Gueant and he discussed counter-terrorism, Turkey's EU process and visa exemption for Turkish citizens in the EU.\n\n-TURKEY'S POSITION ON ARMENIAN ALLEGATIONS-   \n\nTurkey has long been facing a systematic campaign of defamation carried out by Armenian lobbying groups. The Armenian diaspora has lately increased its organized activities throughout the world for the recognition of their unfounded allegations in regard to the events of 1915 as \"genocide\" by national and local parliaments.\nArmenian groups living in various countries try to get the publication of many books on their allegations concerning the events of 1915 and articles written by authors close to Armenian views in well-known magazines and newspapers. Armenian organizations also orchestrate many meetings, conferences and symposia in order to garner support and to give them as much publicity as possible. Armenian groups make sure that researchers and authors close to the Armenian views take part in these meetings so that the issue always remains on the agenda. Armenian circles, similarly, sponsor the making of documentary films that advocate Armenian claims. They also encourage the broadcasting of these films in many television channels. Public opinion especially in Western countries is affected by these films, books and articles published every year and their Parliaments are left under constant pressure to recognize the Armenian allegations as \"undeniable historical truth\". The activities of diaspora organizations are also supported by the Armenian state. It is known that Armenian diplomatic missions abroad carry out certain activities so that their allegations are recognized in national legislatures.\nUntil today the parliaments of Argentina, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Canada, Lebanon, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Uruguay, Greece, the Greek Cypriot Administration, Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Chile, Venezuela and the European Parliament passed either resolutions or issued statements. In addition, some local parliaments in the USA, Canada, Britain, Australia, Argentina and Switzerland passed similar resolutions.\nTurkey is of the view that parliaments and other political institutions are not the appropriate fora to debate and pass judgments on disputed periods of history. Past events and controversial periods of history should be left to the historians for their dispassionate study and evaluation. In order to shed light on such a disputed historical issue, the Turkish Government has opened all its archives, including military records to all researchers. Furthermore, Turkey encourages historians, scholars and researchers to freely examine and discuss this historical issue in every platform. In order to have an objective and complete analysis of the Turkish-Armenian relations, the Armenian archives should also be opened and made available to the public and researchers. For reaching the truth, historians must have access to all related archives.\nIn this respect, in 2005, Turkey has officially proposed to the Government of Armenia the establishment of a joint commission of history composed of historians and other experts from both sides to study together the events of 1915 not only in the archives of Turkey and Armenia but also in the archives of all relevant third countries and to share their findings with the public. Unfortunately, Armenia has not responded positively to this initiative, yet. Turkey's proposal is still on the table.\nIf accepted by Armenia, Turkey's proposal for setting up a Joint Commission of History would also serve as a confidence-building measure paving the way for a dialogue towards normalization of relations between the two countries.\nTurkey and Armenia signed protocols in 2009 to normalize relations.\nDozens of Turkish diplomats and family members as well as Turkish citizens have either been assassinated or wounded in attacks perpetrated by Armenian terrorists during the 1970s and 1980s",

Residents of Van had lived together with citizens of Armenian origin till 1915.\nArmenians consider visiting Akdamar Church as a religious duty.\nThanks to proposal of Van Governor's Office and approval of Culture & Tourism Minister Ertugrul Gunay, Akdamar Church was opened to rite for the first time since 1915.\nThousands of Armenians are expected to arrive in Van on the day of rite.\nTurkey's decision to open Akdamar Church for a single-day rite, was met with enthusiasm by Armenian communities across the world.\nThe 1,100-year-old Akdamar Church was opened in 2007 at a ceremony that hosted officials from Armenia and Turkey after it was restored by the Turkish government. The restoration costed some 1.7 million USD.\nAkdamar Church was constructed by architect bishop Manuel between 915 and 921 A.D. under the supervision of King Gagik I. Among the important pieces of Armenian architecture, the church draws attraction with its stone workmanship and the relieves on its walls.\nEarlier this March, Turkish government gave permission for a single-day religious that would take place once every year at the church.\nTurkish officials believe it will boost religious tourism in the region.",

Howard Berman,shortly before the voting warning that such a vote would jeopardize reconciliation talks between Turkey and Armenia.\nThe adoption of the resolution stirred wide reaction in Turkey which strongly rejects the genocide allegations and regards the events as civil strife in wartime which claimed lives of many Turks and Armenians.\nDavutoglu told an exclusive press conference Friday that the Obama administration's late intervention showed it did not put enough weight around the issue.\nHe said adoption of the resolution not only risked slowing down of the recent rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia but completely jeopardised the process, urging the U.S. administration to exert more efforts to stop such attempts.\nDavutoglu said Turkey made great contributions to the peaceful vision of the Obama administration noting that these should not be sacrificed for domestic political ends.\nHe said those who argued that the adoption of the resolution would pressurize Turkish,Parliament to adopt the protocols were dead wrong, adding that Turkey did not make foreign policy decisions under pressure.\nDavutoglu callled on the  the U.S. House of Representatives to review their position on this issue noting that their reckless resolution hampered a historic peace between Turkey and Armenia and harmed the Turkey-U.S. relations.\nDavutoglu said Turkey summoned its ambassador to U.S. Namık Tan to Ankara to discuss t Turkey's possibble reaction, and steps to be taken in Turkey's relation's with the U.S. .\nHe said they would also discuss the issue with the President, the cabinet and the opposition, adding that the issue was a matter of national honour for Turkey.",

      "content": "\"What we are saying is regardless of whether you accept Turkey or not, we are already in the EU. There are five million Turks in EU countries already. You will only lose by leaving us behind,\" Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Friday a televised interview on English-broadcasting news channel, Russia Today.\nErdogan said Turkey would not become an additional burden for the EU, but it would actually lift some of the existing burdens the EU had.\n\"There are countries already in the EU which cannot compete with Turkey in terms of freedom and economy. Why do not they accept Turkey? When you take a closer look at this, you see political reasons,\" he said.\n\"If the European Union makes a permanent decision not to accept us, then Turkey will make its decision based on that. But since we are holding talks with the new EU chairman, we are about to enter a new stage. During this new period we can take many different steps. We can make progress on many aspects, I believe,\" Erdogan said.\nResponding to a question on whether he was poised to become a leader of the Muslim world as a result of Turkey's multilateral foreign policy, Erdogan said he had not tried to become a leader of the Islamic world.\n\"I did not put any effort into becoming one. Things like this do not happen just because someone wants to occupy this or that post. The thing is, we believed in something. We believed in serving our people in the best way possible. Of course, here in Turkey, we wanted to establish equal relationships with other countries, because there is a problem of inequality in our world,\" Erdogan said.\nOver a question on the Nabucco and South Stream gas pipelines, Erdogan said Turkey was not a partner in the South Stream project.\n\"We are partners in Nabucco, though, and are involved in it. I see them as complimentary projects. Europe cannot be satisfied with either Nabucco or South Stream, but both projects can meet the demand of Europe and fill a very big gap,\" Erdogan said.\n\"We are involved in the South Stream project at the level of research and exploration. And Nabucco, as you know, involves six countries: Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Austria and Germany. Companies in these countries have taken up this project. Of course, we are a transit country, but there are supplying and consumer countries as well. Turkey is also a consumer country. So, we need to implement the Nabucco project as fast as we can. I, personally, and the relevant ministers and authorities continue to work on this as we want to launch Nabucco as soon as possible.\"\nResponding to a question on relations with Armenia, Erdogan said that in 2005 he had sent a letter to former President Robert Kocharian, proposing that historians should investigate the incidents of 1915.\n\"There has been no reply. This is the job of historians, not politicians. Besides, the Turkish nation, our grandparents, did not commit genocide. They just would not have done it ... The Ottoman Empire would not have fallen for such a mistake.\n\"What happened was the deportation of people from one area to another, which caused certain conflicts. Both sides suffered losses. You can see this clearly in the historical records as we have opened up our archives now. What we say now is that Armenia should give access to its archives and let investigators do their research so that we can reach a solution. Simple as that. But Armenia is not doing this, and since this is the case, they do not have the grounds to accuse Turkey. We will never accept blame for such a thing,\" Erdogan said.\nResponding to a question on Turkey-U.S. relations, Erdogan said the two countries working together on many issues together  \n\"We are together on the issues of Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon. Apart from that, of course, we are also working with the U.S. in the Balkans and in Kosovo and everywhere else where NATO is present. Turkey is alongside the United States, especially in terms of military. As for politics, there are also areas where we cooperate within many different international organizations and commissions,\" Erdogan said.\n\"Currently though – and I will be very frank with you – if we look at economic cooperation, our primary partner is the Russian Federation, with a $38 billion turnover as of the end of 2008. That is predominantly in the field of energy, where we have very intensive cooperation. Our turnover with the United States is around $12 billion. We definitely need to further our economic cooperation with the U.S. I am not saying that there is competition between the U.S. and Russia in this respect. What I am saying is that we are open for cooperation, and we want to expand it. Actually, we need each other.\"",

It is up to the parliament to decide when to approve or not approve the protocols, Davutoglu said.\nFollowing the approval at the parliament, the protocols will go into effect in two months. It is out of the question to open the borders automatically after the signing of the protocols, Davutoglu stressed.\nThe occupation of Upper Karabakh is not a legitimate one. We are rightful to establish parallelism between the normalization process and the illegitimate occupation, Davutoglu said.\nIt will be a gain for Armenia to improve relations with Azerbaijan, Davutoglu said.\nIf not today, the occupation there will end tomorrow. The earlier the occupation ends, the more gain will be achieved by all, Davutoglu said.\nWe desire to lift borders around Turkey as time passes. We aim at getting closer economically and culturally with Turkey's neighbors, Davutoglu said.\nArmenia is presently out of the equation in the region. Unless there is peace, it would be impossible for Armenia to join the equation, Davutoglu stressed.\nTouching on the incidents of 1915, Davutoglu said that it would be a great mistake to turn individual reactions into state policy.\nThe (Armenian) diaspora should not direct Armenia. It is crucial for Armenia to develop policies that protect its own interests, Davutoglu noted.\nDavutoglu pointed out the importance of establishing a joint historical commission and establishing a \"just memory\".\nIn reference to the participation at the signature ceremony in Zurich, Davutoglu said that no foreign actor was influential in the process that led to the protocols.\nThe only foreign influence came from Switzerland as the mediator, Davutoglu said.\nThe protocols were shaped by the will of the government of the Republic of Turkey, Davutoglu said.\nReminding that the Progress Report on Turkey will be announced this week, Davutoglu said that every positive step taken by Turkey will add momentum to Turkey's EU process.\nA Turkey that is not effective in its region could not become a respectable member of the EU, Davutoglu said.\nAsked if the Armenian President Serzh Sargsian will arrive in Turkish province of Bursa to watch a soccer game between the national teams of Turkey and Armenia, Davutoglu said that \"it is Turkey's wish to see Sargsian display the political courage and maturity that Turkish President Abdullah Gul displayed.
