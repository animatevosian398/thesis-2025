# Narratives of Truth and Denial

## Abstract

Genocide denial comments become data in this analysis of Armenian Genocide narratives circulating online. Examining over 10,000 YouTube comments alongside official Turkish government statements, this project visualizes how state narratives and propaganda shape public discourse. The interactive visualization reveals which government denial narratives are frequently echoed online, displaying both the scale and intensification of these statements. Machine learning classification identifies twelve distinct rhetorical stances, from explicit denial to minimization and justification. The comments form a searchable and downloadable archive—filterable by year, likes, and video source—transforming toxic content into a resource for studying genocide denial in digital spaces.
