s5a0tqvkgCY,"There was never a genocide order. ƒ∞t was a relocation order. Some Kurdish and Turkish commanders commited atrocies( such as not giving them food or executing random people) but they weren't ordered by the government. Afterwards those commanders were judged and executed by the goverment and British people was also there to witness the procedure.
 Afterwards, British people looked up all the archives on Ottoman Empire to find genocide orders but couldn't find any. 3-4 years ago Turkish government also offered to Armenians to open up both countires plus Russia's archives( Because the conflict with Armenians started because Russian's gave some armenian militans guns and those armenian terror groups started massacring innocent Turks and Kurds in Anatolia in the middle of war.)
 But Armenia refused to open their archives which says a lot about what they have done towards turkish and Kurdish people at that time as well.
 By the way, only Armenian people on the eastern side were affected by this, tens of thousands of Armenians living in ƒ∞stanbul or ƒ∞zmir were never touched. Armenians at that time were a priviliged minority and those on the big cities were extremely rich( And tehy are still like that to this day.)
 In short, no there wasn't a genocide because no one gave the order to massacre Armenians and there is no evidence of it to this day. Some commanders commiting atrocies won't change that fact.
 Conflict started because Armenian terror groups manipulated and armed by Russia started massacres in east anatolia.
 ƒ∞nvestigate more before assuming things. Armenians and Russia will never open their archives about this matter because most countries in the world chooses to blame Turkey. ƒ∞f they open their archives their atrocities will also be revealed to public. That's why years ago Armenia refused to open their archives and they will never open it.
 They are used to hating on Turks for their own action's consequences, and world is supporting them. So why bother searching for truth on international community? ƒ∞t is easier to blame turks and exaggerate all the events so that world will feel pity for them while blaming everything on Turks and Kurds.
 Of course  most people won't even feel the need to investigate such things. They like being ignorant and blaming one party( the party that most of the world hates for being muslims, fighting with europe in the past etc.)
 This was the first point. 
 Now, even if we ignore all this and ASSUME Armenian Genocide is PROVEN and Turkey apologised, this still won't change that most people are trying to spread anti-turkish propaganda and use this subject in politics as a tool. As if Turks should be ashamed of the doings of an empire that was abolished by our current government. They are forcing the turks to apologise as if the doings of a century old thing that a government that didn't belong to us have anything to do with us.
 Armenian people for hundreds of years in Ottoman Empire  was able to live a rich life in city, not join army, practice their religion.
 What about the 2 Million+ Muslims killed in Balkan Wars? Why not Balkan countries apologise from Turkey for genociding muslims after the balkan wars? LEt me tell you. Because for western world only the lives of white and christians matter. 
 Today most of the black people speak French or Spanish. European powers enslaved them, destroyed their culture, made them fight in wars that didn't belong to them, stole their resources and massacred millions of them. 
 Why is there not any videos heavily condomning and spreading anti- european propoganda? Your 'modern' nations were build upon millions of massacres and slavery, genocides of muslims.
 At least our ancestors didn't destroy entire nation's language, culture and religion. Greek people still know their history, roots, religion and have their culture. Same for bulgarians, armanians and other Balkan countries. None of their culture were destroyed, tehy are still christian and know their history.
 So, even if Armenian Genocide did happen. As a Turk I will at most offer my condolances. As for saying sorry? No. 
 First let's hear you guys apologise for millions of muslims genocided in Balkan Wars. Than apologise for the cultures you have completely destroyed, making  continents of slaves, killing all the natives in America. 
 Western world has much more crimes on humanity than  Turks. But I never hear someone blaming them nor spreading hate about their history? Why? Cause they are strong and control the media, also because they didn't leave some people behind to hate on them, they completely destroyed their culture.
 The Day Armenia opens it archives and proves a genocide order was given,
 The day western world stop acting like an hypocrite and gloss over their historical atrocities like 'Opps, yeah that happened, sorry lol. Anyways, lets talk more about muslim and ottoman atrocities! ƒ∞t is more fun!'
 ƒ∞s the day I can say yeah, our ancestors did some terrible stuff, it is proven and should not be forgotten and be remembered as a historical lesson.
 But media ignoring all western atrocities and focusing on this subject over and over again and even forcing us to apologize? We are not Ottomans. Ottomans were abolished by our current government. So I can at most offer condolances. I can't offer an apology for the doings of an emperor from a completely different state that existed a century ago.
 ƒ∞sn't it strange that most atrocities, destroyed cultures, slavery was done by USA and Western europe but media never talks about them and spreads anti-european propaganda. Acting like Europe and USA are the rightous heroes of the world while turks and other nations are shady nations that should be held responsible for their crimes. As long as this attidute of Western world doesn't change
 speaking about history objectively will also be hard.
 So, Armenia open the archives. I don't even need Armenia to prove the genocide. As long as there are no Armenian atrocities( The terror attacks on Kurdish and Turkish villages and massacring of them) are not found on the archives, I will accept the genocide and unlike the western world, as long as it is proven I will be sincere about it. I will not gloss over it or ignore it like the western world about their atrocities. But that is not possible. Armenia and Russia will never ever open the archives about that year, because everyone already blames turks without listening to their side of the story. Why expose yourself while everyone blames Turks and world pressures it to apologise? ƒ∞t is easier this way",Y,,@fy4072,5,2022-11-17T22:05:25Z,True,procedural_deflection_using_archives_and_evidence,0.9333651304245,"[('procedural_deflection_using_archives_and_evidence', 0.9333651304244995), ('competitive_victimhood', 0.9205610275268555), ('historical_affirmation_of_Armenian_Genocide', 0.9188912749290467)]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5a0tqvkgCY

In fact, there are many Armenians still living in Turkey. One of the biggest mistakes of the Young Turks was that they were blindly ultranationalists and could not embrace the Armenians and caused them to establish terrorist organizations. In the end, it was the Young Turks who brought the Ottomans to destruction. In times of war, you would not have many options to protect minorities who take up arms and help the enemy from angry crowds. In fact, what happened to the Armenians was not much different from what happened to the Muslim peoples in the Balkans and the north of the Black Sea. I wish the Dashnaksutyun Armenian Terrorist Organization had never been established and the Armenians had not bet on the wrong horse.
 
 No matter how hard you try, you cannot turn the Armenian events into a so-called genocide. It is neither similar to the holocaust nor to the genocide that Israel is currently committing in Palestine. There is nothing similar to the Bosnian genocide of the Serbs, the Algerian genocide of the French, or the Karabakh genocide of the Armenians. Even if you count the armed militants, it is impossible to reach the numbers mentioned today.  In this video a lot of incomplete, incorrect and changed information was given. Armenians committed the first terrorist act in history. They carried out a bomb attack on the Ottoman Sultan, against whom the Young Turks had staged a coup, at the exit of the Mosque. While Sultan survived by chance, 26 people died and 58 people were injured. So, to make a long story short, the Ottomans did not see the Armenians as a threat out of the blue, as described in the video. For years, with the instigation of the Armenian lobbies in France and Europe and Russia, they had already begun to betray the state in order to get a share of the cake. Long before the First World War, Armenians had already established two armed terrorist organizations. The Young Turks, who dethroned Sultan Abdulhamid II, whom the Armenians labeled the red sultan, made conditions even worse for the Armenians. During the First World War, many nations with a much larger population than the Armenians were deported, and the only nation that claims Genocide is the Armenians.",Y,,@programci3943,3,2023-10-31T12:51:27Z,False,minimization_and_reframing,0.90855211019516,"[('minimization_and_reframing', 0.9085521101951599), ('procedural_deflection_using_archives_and_evidence', 0.7268293499946594), ('justification_narrative', 0.7222850680351258)]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrXxQ6FN3w
